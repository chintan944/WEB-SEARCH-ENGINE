Bash provides an option to extract the information from a string itself. You can extract the digits or a given string using several methods.For example, "welcome you on Javatpoint." is a substring of "We welcome you on Javatpoint."SyntaxThe command for the extraction of substring is a build-in bash command, and so it is very good to use for performance perspective.The syntax of the substring extraction can be defined as:${variable:offset:length}where,Variable is the variable name that contains a string.Offset is used to specify the position from where to start the extraction of a string.Length is used to specify the range of the characters to be executed from the offset.Note: Assigning length is optional. If length is not provided, then end of the string will be considered as the end of the substring.Let's understand the concept of extracting a substring from the string with the help of some examples:Example 1: To Extract till Specific Characters from Starting#!/bin/bash
#Script to extract first 10 characters of a string

echo "String: We welcome you on Javatpoint."
str="We welcome you on Javatpoint."

echo "Total characters in a String: ${#str} "

substr="${str:0:10}"

echo "Substring: $substr"
echo "Total characters in Substring: ${#substr} "OutputExample 2: To Extract from Specific Character onwards#!/bin/bash
#Script to print from 11th character onwards

str="We welcome you on Javatpoint."
substr="${str:11}"
echo "$substr"Outputyou on Javatpoint.Here, end of the string is considered as the end of the substring.Example 3: To Extract a Single Character#!/bin/bash
#Script to print 11th character of a String

str="We welcome you on Javatpoint."
substr="${str:11:1}"
echo "$substr"OutputyExample 4: To Extract the specific characters from last#!/bin/bash
#Script to extract 11 characters from last

str="We welcome you on Javatpoint."
substr="${str:(-11)}"
echo "$substr"OutputJavatpoint.ConclusionIn this topic, we demonstrated how to extract a substring from a string in bash scripting with different types of scenarios and examples.Next TopicBash Concatenate String? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
