However, it can be used to refer to a most important person in a person's life.It is a shortened version (abbreviation) of 'baby' or 'babe'. This term became popular around 2013 and 2014 through social media and hip-hop and R&B lyrics. Some people believe that the term originated as an acronym for 'before anyone else', but this seems to an example of a backronym and is not common.Examples of BAE:"Waiting for bae to come home so we can have dinner together""Me and bae planning to go on a world tour!
