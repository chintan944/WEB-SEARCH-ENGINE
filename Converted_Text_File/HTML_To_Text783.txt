It is the study of abstract machines and the computation problems that can be solved using these machines. The abstract machine is called the automata. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite automaton.In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to construct deterministic finite automata, non-deterministic finite automata, Regular expression, context-free grammar, context-free language, Push down automata, Turning machines, etc.PrerequisiteBefore learning Automata, you should have a basic understanding of string, language, alphabets, symbols.AudienceOur Automata Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.ProblemsWe assure that you will not find any problem in this Automata Tutorial.
