The agile project management focuses on continuous releases and covers customer feedback with every iteration.Traditionally the agile project management is classified into two frameworks: scrum and kanban. The scrum framework focused fixed-length project iterations, whereas kanban framework focused on continuous releases. After competition of project first iteration (or steps) project management activity immediately moves on to the next.History of Agile Project ManagementAgile project management is rapidly rising in the 21st century. It is used for software development projects and other IT initiatives.However, from the mid-20th century, the concept of continuous development has taken various forms. For example, there was James Martin's Rapid Iterative Production Prototyping (RIPP), an approach that served as the premise for the 1991 book Rapid Application Development (RAD).The agile project management framework which has emerged in most recent years is known as Scrum. This methodology features works on the development team to create a product backlog. It also creates a prioritized list of the features, functionalities, and fixes required to deliver a successful software system. The scrum team offers the pieces of a task in rapid increments.How Agile Project Management worksThe agile project management calls for teams to regularly evaluate cost and time as they move through their work. They use velocity, burnup and burndown charts to measure their work, rather than Gantt charts and project milestones to track progress.The agile team practices to continuous development and continuous integration using technology that automates steps to speed up the release and use of products.The presence and participation of the project manager are not required in agile project management. Although the presence of the project manager is essential for success under the traditional (waterfall model) project delivery. The role of the project manager is to distribute task among team members. However, the project manager is not obsolete in agile project management, and many organizations use them in a large, more complex project. The organization mostly places them in the project coordinator role.Agile Project Management demands that team members know how to work in this new agile methodology. The team member must be able to coordinate with each other, as well as with users.Next TopicAgile Scrum? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
