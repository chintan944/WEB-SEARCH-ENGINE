In some cases, we might need to know about the length of a string to perform some specific tasks. Most of the programming languages have their own built-in functions to calculate the number of characters. However, Bash does not contain such type of built-in functions. But there are several ways that we can use to find the length of a string in Bash Scripting.Bash StringLengthTo calculate the length of a string, we can use any of the following syntax:1.	${#string}
2.	expr length "$string"
3.	expr "$string" :'.*'
4.	$str | wc -c
5.	$str |awk '{print length}'Note: Observe the double quotes used around $string. If a string has spaces in it, then double quotes are very important. Otherwise, it can be ignored. We recommend to always use double quotes around $string to be on the safe side.The above syntax defines that we can find the length of a string with or without bash command. Using '#' sign, we can calculate the length of a string without applying any bash command. Let's understand it more clearly with the help of some examples:Examples to find String Length in BashThere are some examples given below illustrating the different ways to find a string length in bash shell scripting:Example 1The simplest way to calculate the length of a string is to use '#' symbol. In this example, we have used $[#string_variable_name} to find the length of a string.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Bash program to find the length of a string

str="Welcome to Javatpoint"
length=${#str}

echo "Length of '$str' is $length"OutputLength of 'Welcome to Javatpoint' is 21Example 2Another way to calculate the length of a string is to use `expr` command with the 'length' keyword. In this example, we have used `expr length "$str"` to find the length of a string.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Bash script to find the length of a string

str="Welcome to Javatpoint"
length=`expr length "$str"`

echo "Length of '$str' is $length"OutputLength of 'Welcome to Javatpoint' is 21Example 3In this example, we have used `expr "$str": ' .*'`to find the length of a string. Here, str is a string variable.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Bash script to find the length of a string

str="Welcome to Javatpoint"
length=`expr "$str" : '.*'`

echo "Length of '$str' is $length"OutputLength of 'Welcome to Javatpoint' is 21Example 4In this example, we have used `wc` command to find the length of a string.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Bash script to find the length of a string

str="Welcome to Javatpoint"
length=`echo $str | wc -c`

echo "Length of '$str' is $length"OutputLength of 'Welcome to Javatpoint' is 22Example 5In this example, we have used `awk` command to find the length of a string.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Bash script to find the length of a string

str="Welcome to Javatpoint"
length=`echo $str |awk '{print length}'`

echo "Length of '$str' is $length"OutputLength of 'Welcome to Javatpoint' is 21ConclusionIn this topic, we have learned about the syntax to find the length of a string with the examples.Next TopicBash Split String? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
