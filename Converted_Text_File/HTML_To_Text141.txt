It is a type of blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow where it affects the immature blood cells (myeloid cells) that are precursors to other blood cells like red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.

Eventually, there will be a shortage of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the body of affected person.There are different types of AML based on the type of leukemic cells present in the blood and bone marrow. It is also known as acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.AML is caused by unfavorable changes (mutations) in the genes of the DNA of myeloid cells present in the bone marrow.
