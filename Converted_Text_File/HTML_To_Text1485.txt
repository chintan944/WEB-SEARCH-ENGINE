Instead, it means a region which theoretically can contain an infinite number of points. Scan-Converting a point involves illuminating the pixel that contains the point.Example: Display coordinates points as shown in fig would both be represented by pixel (2, 1). In general, a point p (x, y) is represented by the integer part of x & the integer part of y that is pixels [(INT (x), INT (y).Next TopicScan Converting a Straight Line? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
