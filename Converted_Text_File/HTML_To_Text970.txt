These instructions are stored in computer memory.These instructions are executed to process data which are already loaded in the computer memory through some input devices.After processing the data, the result is either stored in the memory for further reference, or it is sent to the outside world through some output port.To perform the execution of an instruction, in addition to the arithmetic logic unit, and control unit, the processor contains a number of registers used for temporary storage of data and some special function registers.The special function registers include program counters (PC), instruction registers (IR), memory address registers (MAR) and memory and memory data registers (MDR).The Program counter is one of the most critical registers in CPU.The Program counter monitors the execution of instructions. It keeps track on which instruction is being executed and what the next instruction will be.The instruction register IR is used to hold the instruction that is currently being executed.The contents of IR are available to the control unit, which generate the timing signals that control, the various processing elements involved in executing the instruction.The two registers MAR and MDR are used to handle the data transfer between the main memory and the processor.The MAR holds the address of the main memory to or from which data is to be transferred.The MDR contains the data to be written into or read from the addressed word of the main memory.Whenever the processor is asked to communicate with devices, we say that the processor is servicing the devices. The processor can service these devices in one of the two ways.One way is to use the polling routine, and the other way is to use an interrupt.Polling enables the processor software to check each of the input and output devices frequently. During this check, the processor tests to see if any devices need servicing or not.Interrupt method provides an external asynchronous input that informs the processor that it should complete whatever instruction that is currently being executed and fetch a new routine that will service the requesting device.Next TopicGeneral System Architecture? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
