It executes on the server and generates output to the browser. It is compatible to any browser to any language supported by .NET common language runtime. It is flexible and allows us to create and add custom controls.We can use Visual Studio to create ASP.NET Web Forms. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows us to drag and drop server controls to the web forms. It also allows us to set properties, events and methods for the controls. To write business logic, we can choose any .NET language like: Visual Basic or Visual C#.Web Forms are made up of two components: the visual portion (the ASPX file), and the code behind the form, which resides in a separate class file.Fig: This diagram shows the components of the ASP.NETThe main purpose of Web Forms is to overcome the limitations of ASP and separate view from the application logic.ASP.NET provides various controls like: server controls and HTML controls for the Web Forms. We have tables all these controls below.Server ControlsThe following table contains the server-side controls for the Web Forms.Control NameApplicable EventsDescriptionLabelNoneIt is used to display text on the HTML page.TextBoxTextChangedIt is used to create a text input in the form.ButtonClick, CommandIt is used to create a button.LinkButtonClick, CommandIt is used to create a button that looks similar to the hyperlink.ImageButtonClickIt is used to create an imagesButton. Here, an image works as a Button.HyperlinkNoneIt is used to create a hyperlink control that responds to a click event.DropDownListSelectedIndexChangedIt is used to create a dropdown list control.ListBoxSelectedIndexCnhagedIt is used to create a ListBox control like the HTML control.DataGridCancelCommand, EditCommand, DeleteCommand, ItemCommand, SelectedIndexChanged, PageIndexChanged, SortCommand, UpdateCommand, ItemCreated, ItemDataBoundIt used to create a frid that is used to show data. We can also perform paging, sorting, and formatting very easily with this control.DataListCancelCommand, EditCommand, DeleteCommand, ItemCommand, SelectedIndexChanged, UpdateCommand, ItemCreated, ItemDataBoundIt is used to create datalist that is non-tabular and used to show data.RepeaterItemCommand, ItemCreated, ItemDataBoundIt allows us to create a non-tabular type of format for data. You can bind the data to template items, which are like bits of HTML put together in a specific repeating format.CheckBoxCheckChangedIt is used to create checkbox.CheckBoxListSelectedIndexChangedIt is used to create a group of check boxes that all work together.RadioButtonCheckChangedIt is used to create radio button.RadioButtonListSelectedIndexChangedIt is used to create a group of radio button controls that all work together.ImageNoneIt is used to show image within the page.PanelNoneIt is used to create a panel that works as a container.PlaceHolderNoneIt is used to set placeholder for the control.CalendarSelectionChanged, VisibleMonthChanged, DayRenderIt is used to create a calendar. We can set the default date, move forward and backward etc.AdRotatorAdCreatedIt allows us to specify a list of ads to display. Each time the user re-displays the page.TableNoneIt is used to create table.XMLNoneIt is used to display XML documents within the HTML.LiteralNoneIt is like a label in that it displays a literal, but allows us to create new literals at runtime and place them into this control.HTML ControlsThese controls render by the browser. We can also make HTML controls as server control. we will discuss about this in further our tutorial.Controls NameDescriptionButtonIt is used to create HTML button.Reset ButtonResets all other HTML form elements on a form to a default valueSubmit ButtonAutomatically POSTs the form data to the specified page listed in the Action attribute in the FORM tagText FieldGives the user an input area on an HTML formText AreaUsed for multi-line input on an HTML formFile FieldPlaces a text field and a Browse button on a form and allows the user to select a file name from their local machine when the Browse button is clickedPassword FieldAn input area on an HTML form, although any characters typed into this field are displayed as asterisksCheckBoxGives the user a check box that they can select or clearRadio ButtonUsed two or more to a form, and allows the user to choose one of the controlsTableAllows you to present information in a tabular formatImageDisplays an image on an HTML formListBoxDisplays a list of items to the user.
