It basically manipulates the images and achieves the desired output. It includes conversion, sharpening, blurring, detecting edges, retrieval, and recognition of images.2) Medical FieldThere are several applications under medical field which depends on the functioning of digital image processing.Gamma-ray imagingPET scanX-Ray ImagingMedical CT scanUV imaging3) Robot visionThere are several robotic machines which work on the digital image processing. Through image processing technique robot finds their ways, for example, hurdle detection root and line follower robot.4) Pattern recognitionIt involves the study of image processing, it is also combined with artificial intelligence such that computer-aided diagnosis, handwriting recognition and images recognition can be easily implemented. Now a days, image processing is used for pattern recognition.5) Video processingIt is also one of the applications of digital image processing. A collection of frames or pictures are arranged in such a way that it makes the fast movement of pictures. It involves frame rate conversion, motion detection, reduction of noise and colour space conversion etc.Next TopicConcept of Dimensions? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
