These data transfer can be represented by standard notations given below:Notations R0, R1, R2..., and so on represent processor registers.The addresses of memory locations are represented by names such as LOC, PLACE, MEM, etc.Input-output registers are represented by names such as DATA IN, DATA OUT and so on.The content of register or memory location is denoted by placing square brackets around the name of the register or memory location.Next TopicRegister Transfer? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
