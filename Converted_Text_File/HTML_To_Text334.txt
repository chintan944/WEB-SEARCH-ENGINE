You can also create and delete the directories and change the permissions of the data.You can also create and delete the soft links (symlinks) as well as hard links. With the help of the Ansible file module, you can set the permission of the files.Creating a File in Remote ServerIn the Ansible file module, we have different parameters. We are using path and state parameters that are must in every file module. In the file parameter, we will mention the path of the file in the remote server. On this path, only the file will be created.At path: It mentions the path of the file in the remote server.At state: It mentions touch, and touch will create file exact like Linux command.Then, it will create a new empty file with the name devops.txt. So mention filename in the path. So in the state: we will mention touch to create the file.- name: create the file in a remote server
  file:
   path: /path/to/file/in/remote/server/devops.txt
   state: touchDeleting a File in Remote ServerIf you want to delete any command in the remote server. So at path parameter, mention the path of the file which you want to delete.At path: Mention the path of the file in the remote server.At state: Mention absent to delete the file.So in the state: we will use touch to create the file, absent to delete the e file.- name:  delete the file in a remote server
  file:
   path: /etc/abcd.conf
   state: absentCreating a File with PermissionsWe can also create the file with permission by using the file module.At the mode parameter: we have 4 digits. Always mention zero at the starting, and remaining digits will be your file permissions.At owner parameter: mention the owner of the file.tasks:  
  - name: Ansible file module to create a new file with permissions.     
    file:      
    path: /path/to/cretae/file/devops.txt    
    state: touch      
    mode: 0421      
    owner: devopsThis permission will be set to that newly created file.file:    
 path: /path/to/cretae/file/devops.txt   
 state: touch    
 mode: "u=rw,g=w,o=e"    
 owner: devopsBoth the codes work the same, but in the other code, we are using the symbolic mode, which is equivalent to 0421.Creating Multiple FilesA path parameter: we can create a loop to create multiple files by using "{{item}}".At with_items parameter: mention file names which you want to create.By using "{{item}}" and with_items parameter, we can create loop or multiple files.tasks:  
- name: Ansible file module to create multiple files    
  file:       
   path: "{{ item }}"      
   state: touch     
   mode: 0421    
  with_items:    
  - devops1.txt    
  - devops2.txt    
  - devops3.txtDeleting Multiple FilesThe code will be the same to create multiple files and to delete files but a small change in the state parameter.State parameter: Touch the create files and absent to delete files.- name: Ansible file module to delete multiple files 
  file:                  
   path: "{{ item }}"    
   state: absent  
  with_items:    
  - devops1.txt    
  - devops2.txt
