So when we talk about alternate key, the column may not be primary key but still it is a unique key in the column.An alternate key is just a candidate key that has not been selected as the primary key.Next TopicSQL vs NoSQL? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
