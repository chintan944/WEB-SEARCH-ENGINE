Inside Direct Connect Location, we have two cages, i.e., AWS cage and customer/partner cage. AWS cage consists of Direct Connect routers, and Customer/Partner cage consists of Cust/Part Routers.You have a dedicated link from your data center which is labeled as Last Mile Pseudowire/ LAN Extension. AWS have their own backbone network as well. Through AWS Backbone Network, they are connecting to DX Router over DX connection. X-Connect is connecting DX Routers and Cust/Part Routers. It also consists of a dedicated line connecting the Cust/Part Router to the Customer WAN/MAN Router. What happens is when we run a connection, Cust/Part Router connects to the DX Router through X-Connect. DX-Router connects to the AWS public services through DX Connection. Similarly, a customer data center can connect to the VPC services.Features of Direct ConnectReduces Your Bandwidth CostsIf you have heavy workloads that you want to run in AWS, then AWS reduces the network costs in two ways:Direct Connect can transfer the data into and out of AWS directly.Direct Connect uses a dedicated link which has a lower data transfer rate than internet data transfer rate.Consistent Network PerformanceNetwork latency can vary over the internet as the internet is constantly changing how data is routed from point A to point B. Direct Connect allows you to use the choose the data that uses the dedicated connection which provides consistent network performance.Compatible with all AWS servicesDirect Connect is a network service that works with all AWS services which are accessible over the internet such as Amazon Storage Service, Elastic Compute Cloud, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.Private connectivity to your Amazon VPCDirect Connect can be used to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premises directly to AWS VPC. It can provide you private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and VPC. With the help of multiple virtual interfaces, you can establish private connectivity to multiple VPCs.ElasticAmazon Direct Connect can easily scale the connections to meet your needs. Direct Connect can provide up to 10 Gbps connections. DIRECT Connect can provide multiple connections to meet your needs. Direct Connect can be used instead of establishing VPN Connections as Direct Connect avoids the need for VPN hardware.SimpleYou can easily sign up to the Amazon Direct Connect by using the AWS Management Console. AWS Management Console provides a simple view to manage all the connections and virtual interfaces efficiently. You can even download the router template after configuring one or more virtual interfaces.Next TopicNAT Gateways? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
