For this, we use Routh Hurwitz Criterion to check the stability of the system. If the above-given conditions are not satisfied, then the system is said to be unstable. This criterion is given by A. Hurwitz and E.J. Routh.Advantages of Routh- Hurwitz CriterionWe can find the stability of the system without solving the equation.We can easily determine the relative stability of the system.By this method, we can determine the range of K for stability.By this method, we can also determine the point of intersection for root locus with an imaginary axis.Limitations of Routh- Hurwitz CriterionThis criterion is applicable only for a linear system.It does not provide the exact location of poles on the right and left half of the S plane.In case of the characteristic equation, it is valid only for real coefficients.The Routh- Hurwitz CriterionConsider the following characteristic PolynomialWhen the coefficients a0, a1, ......................an are all of the same sign, and none is zero.Step 1: Arrange all the coefficients of the above equation in two rows:Step 2: From these two rows we will form the third row:Step 3: Now, we shall form fourth row by using second and third row:Step 4: We shall continue this procedure of forming a new rows:ExampleCheck the stability of the system whose characteristic equation is given bys4 + 2s3+6s2+4s+1 = 0SolutionObtain the arrow of coefficients as followsSince all the coefficients in the first column are of the same sign, i.e., positive, the given equation has no roots with positive real parts; therefore, the system is said to be stable.Next TopicP, PI and PID Controller? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
