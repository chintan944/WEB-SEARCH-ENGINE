For instance, PC (8-15), R2 (5), etc.Data Transfer from one register to another register is represented in symbolic form by means of replacement operator. For instance, the following statement denotes a transfer of the data of register R1 into register R2.  R2 ? R1Typically, most of the users want the transfer to occur only in a predetermined control condition. This can be shown by following if-then statement:If (P=1) then (R2 ? R1); Here P is a control signal generated in the control section.It is more convenient to specify a control function (P) by separating the control variables from the register transfer operation. For instance, the following statement defines the data transfer operation under a specific control function (P).  P:  R2 ? R1The following image shows the block diagram that depicts the transfer of data from R1 to R2.Here, the letter 'n' indicates the number of bits for the register. The 'n' outputs of the register R1 are connected to the 'n' inputs of register R2.A load input is activated by the control variable 'P' which is transferred to the register R2.Next TopicBus and Memory Transfer? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
