This time that is required to change from one state to another state is known as transient time and the value of current and voltage during this period is called transient response.Depending upon the parameters of the system, the transient may have oscillations which may be either sustained or decaying in nature.Thus time response of a control system is divided into two parts-Transient response analysis.Steady State Analysis.Transient State responseIt deals with the nature of the response of a system when subjected to an input.Steady State AnalysisIt deals with the estimation of the magnitude of steady-state error between input and output.Different Type of Standard Test SignalsThe various inputs or disturbances affecting the performance of a system are mathematically represented as a standard test signal.Step signal ( sudden input )Ramp Signal (velocity type of input )Parabolic Signal ( type of acceleration input )Impulse signal (sudden shock )NOTEStep signal and impulse signal are bounded input signal.Ramp signal and parabolic signal are an unbounded input signal.Step signal, a ramp signal, and periodic signal are for time domain analysis. Only an impulse signal is essential for steady-state analysis.Characteristics of Time-domain AnalysisEvery transfer function representing the control system is of a particular type of order.The steady state analysis depends upon the type of the system.The type of the system is determined from open loop transfer function G(S).H(S)Transient Time: The time required to change from one state to another is called the transient time.Transient Response: The value of current and voltage during the time change is called transient response.So, we can say that the transient response is the part of the response which goes to zero as time increases and the steady-state response is the part of the total response after transient has died. If the steady-state response is the part of the output does not match with the input then the system has a steady state error.Test input signal for transient analysisFor the analysis of the time response of a control system, the following input signals are used.Step FunctionA unit step function is denoted by u(t) and is defined asu(t) = 0   ; t=0
= 1     ;0=tLaplace Transform:Step function is also called displacement function. If input is R(S), then R(s) = 1/sRamp FunctionThis function starts from the origin and linearly decreases or increases with time as shown in the figure above.Let r(t) be the ramp function thenr(t) = 0       ;      t0
= Kt     ;     t>0Where 'K' is the slope of the line, for a positive value of 'K' the slope is upward, and the slope is downward for the negative value of 'K.'Laplace transformParabolic FunctionThe value of r(t) is zero when t0 and is a quadratic function of time when t>0. Therefore r(t) = 0     ; t0
 = (Kt^2)/2    ;   t>0Where 'K' is constant for unit parabolic function K = 1. The unit parabolic function is defined asr (t) = 0     ;  t0 
       = t^2/2    ; t>0Laplace TransformImpulse FunctionA unit impulse function is defined asThus we can say that impulse function has zero value everywhere except at t=0 where the amplitude is infinite.Next TopicTime Response of first order system? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
