It is a controlling system with digital electronic computers used to control machines. It controls, automates, and monitors the movements of a machine. It can be a milling machine, router, welder, grinder, laser cutter etc. These machines are automatic and replaced the old manual machines which always need an operator to run it. It uses numbers as the coordinates of the graphs to control the movement of the cutter. In this way, the computer controls the cutting and shaping of the material. These machines are very useful, accurate and smart because these are control by a computer. The probability of errors is negligible because these machines are not manually operated.For example: If you give a task to a drill machine operator to drill on a aluminum plate, the operator have to measure the points to be drill, has to decide the speed and then starts drilling. In this entire process, there are chances of many types of error that give a poor output.On the other hand, a CNC machine operates automatically for measurement as well as for drilling.CNC MachineCNC controlled machines generally come with several axes of movement and the movements can be rotary, linear or both. Cutout machines like lasers usually come with two axes, X and Y. Milling machines generally come with at least three axes, X, Y and Z. Some milling machines have five axes, three linear axes and two rotary axes that allow the cutter to move in a 180º hemisphere. A robot arm can have more than five axes.Benefits of CNC machineAs it is fully automatic so no operator is needed to continuously monitor it. Due to this reason, the overall performance is improved.Increases productivity and product's finishing.Perfectly meets the company's expectation on the basis of design.Decreases operational costs as compared to manual labors.Great time saver, easy to operate and requires limited supervisionCan be updated by improving the software that controls the machineCan be used continuously, 24 hours a day.Next TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
