These modules can control like services, system resources, files, or packages, etc. and handle executing system commands.Let's see how to execute three different modules from the command line.ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
ansible webservers -m ping
ansible webservers -m command -a "/sbin/reboot -t now"Each module supports taking arguments. Mainly all modules take key=value arguments, space delimited.Some module takes no arguments, and the shell/command modules take the string of the command which you want to execute.From playbook, Ansible modules execute in a very similar way, such as:- name: reboot the servers
  command: /sbin/reboot -t nowHere is another way to pass arguments to a module that is using YAML syntax, and it is also called complex args.- name: restart webserver
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restartedTechnically, all modules return JSON format data, though command line or playbooks, you don't need to know much about that. If you're writing your module, it means you do not have to write modules in any particular language which you get to choose.Modules should be idempotent and avoid making any changes if they detect that the current state matches the desired final state. When using Ansible playbooks, these modules can trigger "change events" in the form of notifying "handlers" to run additional tasks.Documentation for each module can be accessed from the command line with the Ansible-doc tool:ansible-doc yumNext TopicAnsible Shell? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
