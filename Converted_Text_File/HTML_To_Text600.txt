It is also known as classic ASP. It is a server-side technology provided by Microsoft which is used to create dynamic and user-friendly web pages. It uses different scripting languages to create dynamic web pages which can be run on any browsers.2) What is ASP.NET?ASP.Net is a specification by Microsoft which is used to create web applications and web services. It is a part of ".Net framework". You can create ASP.Net applications in most of the .Net compatible languages like Visual Basic, C#, etc. ASP.Net provides much better performance than scripting languages.3) What is the difference between the ASP and ASP.NET?The main difference between ASP and ASP.Net is that ASP is interpreted, while ASP.Net is compiled. ASP uses VBScript, therefore when the ASP page is executed, it is interpreted. On the other hand, ASP.Net uses .Net languages like C# and VB.NET, which is compiled to Microsoft intermediate language.4) What is IIS?IIS stands for Internet Information Services. It is created by Microsoft to provide Internet-based services to ASP.NET Web applications.5) What is the usage of IIS?Following are the main usage of IIS:IIS is used to make your computer to work as a Web server and provides the functionality to develop and deploy Web applications on the server.IIS handles the request and response cycle on the Web server.IIS also offers the services of SMTP and FrontPage server extensions.The SMTP is used to send emails and use FrontPage server extensions to get the dynamic features of IIS, such as form handler.6) What is a multilingual website?If a website provides content in many languages, it is known as a multilingual website. It contains multiple copies of its content and other resources, such as date and time, in different languages.7) What is caching? Explain.Caching is the technique which facilitates you to store frequently used items in memory so that they can be accessed more quickly.8) what are the main requirements for caching?By caching the response, your request is served by the response already stored in memory.You must be very careful while choosing the items to cache because Caching incurs overhead.A frequently used web form which data doesn't frequently change is good for caching.A cached web form freezes form?s server-side content, and changes to that content do not appear until the cache is refreshed.9) What are the advantages of ASP.NET?ASP.Net is the next generation of ASP technology platform. It is superior to ASP in the following ways:Highly ScalableCompiled CodeUser AuthenticationLanguage SupportThird party controlConfiguration and Deployment are easy.Object and Page cachingStrict coding requirements10) What is the concept of Postback in ASP.NET?Postback is a request which is sent from a client to the server from the same page user is working with. There is an HTTP POST request mechanism in ASP.NET. It posts a complete page back to the server to refresh the whole page.11) What is the used of "isPostBack" property?The "IsPostBack" property of page object is used to check that the page is posted back or not.12) How do you identify that the page is PostBack?There is a property named "IsPostBack" property in Post object, which can be checked to know that the page is posted back.13) What is the parent class of all web server control?System.Web.UI.Control class14) What is the difference between ASP.NET Webforms and ASP.NET MVC?ASP.NET Webforms uses the page controller approach for rendering layout.

A session id is generated if a user enters in the application and when the user leaves the application, the session id is automatically deleted.On the other hand, the application object is used to store the information and access variables from any page in the application.17) What is the difference between trace and debug?Debug class is used to debug builds. Trace class is used for both debug and release builds.18) What is the difference between client-side and server-side validations in WebPages?The client-side validation happens at the client's side with the help of JavaScript and VBScript. This validation has occurred before the Web page is sent to the server.The server-side validation happens at the server side.19) What is the difference between file-based dependency and key-based dependency?File-based dependency: File-based dependency facilitates you to save the dependency on a file in a disk.Key-based dependency: In key-based dependency, you depend on another cached item.20) What is the difference between globalization and localization?Globalization: Globalization is a technique to identify the part of a Web application that is different for different languages and separate it out from the web application.Localization: In localization, you try to configure a Web application so that it can be supported for a specific language or locale.21) What is the difference between a page theme and a global theme?Page Theme: The page theme is applied to particular web pages of the project.

Server controls like Data Grid, Data List, and Repeater can have other child controls inside them..Net Interview QuestionsC# Interview QuestionsSQL Server Interview QuestionsWCF Interview QuestionsJava Basics Interview QuestionsJava OOPs Interview QuestionsServlet Interview QuestionsJSP Interview QuestionsSpring Interview QuestionsHibernate Interview QuestionsPL/SQL Interview QuestionsSQL Interview QuestionsOracle Interview QuestionsAndroid Interview QuestionsJavatpoint ServicesJavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
