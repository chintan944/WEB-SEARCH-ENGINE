It is just like an addition to Bash if-else statement. In Bash elif, there can be several elif blocks with a boolean expression for each one of them. In the case of the first 'if statement', if a condition goes false, then the second 'if condition' is checked.Syntax of Bash Else If (elif)The syntax of else-if statement in Bash shell scripting can be defined as:if [ condition ];
then

elif [ condition ];
then

else

fiJust like if-else, we can use a set of one or more conditions joined using conditional operators. The set of commands are executed when the condition is true. If there is no true condition, then the block of commands inside the 'else statement' is executed.Following are some examples demonstrating the usage of the else-if statement:Example 1Following example consists of two different scenarios wherein the first else-if statement, the condition is true, and in the second else-if statement, the condition is false.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number of quantity:" num

if [ $num -gt 100 ];
then
echo "Eligible for 10% discount"
elif [ $num -lt 100 ];
then
echo "Eligible for 5% discount"
else
echo "Lucky Draw Winner"
echo "Eligible to get the item for free"
fiOutputIf we enter the number of quantity as 110, then the condition of 'if statement' evaluates to true and the output looks like:If we enter the number of quantity as 90 then condition of 'elif statement' evaluates to true, and the output looks like:If we enter the number of quantity as 100, then no condition will be true. In this case, the block of commands inside the 'else statement' is executed, and the output looks like:This is how basic bash else-if works.Example 2This example is demonstrating how to use multiple conditions with the else-if statement in Bash. We use bash logical operators to join multiple conditions.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number of quantity:" num

if [ $num -gt 200 ];
then
echo "Eligible for 20% discount"

elif [[ $num == 200 || $num == 100 ]];
then
echo "Lucky Draw Winner"
echo "Eligible to get the item for free"

elif [[ $num -gt 100 && $num -lt 200 ]];
then
echo "Eligible for 10% discount"

elif [ $num -lt 100 ];
then
echo "No discount"
fiNote: It should be noted that else block is optional.OutputIf we enter the number of quantity as 100, then the output will look like:Try this example by putting different values and check out the results.ConclusionIn this topic, we have learned about the syntax and usage of Bash else-if statement with the examples.Next TopicBash Case? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
