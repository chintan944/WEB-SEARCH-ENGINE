It is the simple way to show how the derivation can be done to obtain some string from a given set of production rules. The derivation tree is also called a parse tree.Parse tree follows the precedence of operators. The deepest sub-tree traversed first. So, the operator in the parent node has less precedence over the operator in the sub-tree.A parse tree contains the following properties:The root node is always a node indicating start symbols.The derivation is read from left to right.The leaf node is always terminal nodes.The interior nodes are always the non-terminal nodes.Example 1:Production rules:E = E + E
E = E * E
E = a | b | cInputa * b + cStep 1:Step 2:Step 2:Step 4:Step 5:Note: We can draw a derivation tree step by step or directly in one step.Example 2:Draw a derivation tree for the string "bab" from the CFG given byS ? bSb | a | bSolution:Now, the derivation tree for the string "bbabb" is as follows:The above tree is a derivation tree drawn for deriving a string bbabb. By simply reading the leaf nodes, we can obtain the desired string. The same tree can also be denoted by,Example 3:Construct a derivation tree for the string aabbabba for the CFG given by,S ? aB | bA
A ? a | aS | bAA
B ? b | bS | aBBSolution:To draw a tree, we will first try to obtain derivation for the string aabbabbaNow, the derivation tree is as follows:Example 4:Show the derivation tree for string "aabbbb" with the following grammar.S ? AB | ?
A ? aB
