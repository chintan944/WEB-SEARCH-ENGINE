They specify how to place your components and business logic in the Angular.Directives are js class and declared as @directive. There are 3 directives in Angular.Component DirectivesStructural DirectivesAttribute DirectivesComponent Directives: Component directives are used in main class. They contain the detail of how the component should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.Structural Directives: Structural directives start with a * sign. These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements. For example, *ngIf and *ngFor.Attribute Directives: Attribute directives are used to change the look and behavior of the DOM elements. For example: ngClass, ngStyle etc.Difference between Attribute Directive and Structural DirectiveAttribute DirectivesStructural DirectivesAttribute directives look like a normal HTML Attribute and mainly used in databinding and event binding.Structural Directives start with a * symbol and look different.Attribute Directives affect only the element they are added to.Structural Directives affect the whole area in the DOM.How to create custom Directives?You can create your own custom directives to use in Angular components.Create a basic attribute directiveYou have seen the attribute directive like ngClass and ngStyle. Now, it's time to create our own attribute directives.First, create a folder. Let's name it "simple-style". Then, create a file within that folder named as "simple-style.directive.ts"import {Directive, ElementRef, OnInit} from '@angular/core';

 @Directive( {
  selector: '[appSimpleStyle]'
})
export class SimpleStyleDirective implements OnInit {
  constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) {
  }
  ngOnInit() {
  this.elementRef.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
  }Now, you have to inform Angular that you have a new directive. So, you have to add SimpleStyleDirective to app.module.ts and also import it.import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import {SimpleStyleDirective} from './simple-style/simple-style.directive';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    SimpleStyleDirective
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }Now, your directive is created. Let's check it. Open app.component.html and use your created SimpleStyleDirective<p appSimpleStyle>Style me with your created SimpleStyleDirective</p><div class="container">
  <div class="row">
 <div class="col-xs-12">
   <h2>My Servers</h2>
   <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="OnAddServer()">Add Server</button>
 <br><br>

 <ul class="list-group">
   <li
   class="list-group-item "
   *ngFor="let server of servers; let i = index"
   (click)="onRemoveServer(i)">{{ server }}
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p appSimpleStyle>Style me with your created SimpleStyleDirective</p>
 </div>
 </div>
</div>
</textarea></div>
