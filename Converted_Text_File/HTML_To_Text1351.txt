It uses registers to store the operands of the three address statement.Example:Consider the three address statement x:= y + z. It can have the following sequence of codes:	MOV x, R0
         ADD y, R0
Register and Address Descriptors:A register descriptor contains the track of what is currently in each register. The register descriptors show that all the registers are initially empty.An address descriptor is used to store the location where current value of the name can be found at run time.A code-generation algorithm:The algorithm takes a sequence of three-address statements as input. For each three address statement of the form a:= b op c perform the various actions. These are as follows:Invoke a function getreg to find out the location L where the result of computation b op c should be stored.Consult the address description for y to determine y'. If the value of y currently in memory and register both then prefer the register y' . If the value of y is not already in L then generate the instruction MOV y' , L to place a copy of y in L.Generate the instruction OP z' , L where z' is used to show the current location of z. if z is in both then prefer a register to a memory location. Update the address descriptor of x to indicate that x is in location L. If x is in L then update its descriptor and remove x from all other descriptor.If the current value of y or z have no next uses or not live on exit from the block or in register then alter the register descriptor to indicate that after execution of x : = y op z those register will no longer contain y or z.Generating Code for Assignment Statements:The assignment statement d:= (a-b) + (a-c) + (a-c) can be translated into the following sequence of three address code:t:= a-b
        u:= a-c
        v:= t +u 
        d:= v+uCode sequence for the example is as follows:StatementCode GeneratedRegister descriptorRegister emptyAddress descriptort:= a - bMOV a, R0SUB b, R0R0 contains tt in R0u:= a - cMOV a, R1SUB c, R1R0 contains tR1 contains ut in R0u in R1v:= t + uADD R1, R0R0 contains vR1 contains uu in R1v in R1d:= v + uADD R1, R0MOV R0, dR0 contains dd in R0d in R0 and memoryNext TopicDesign Issues? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
