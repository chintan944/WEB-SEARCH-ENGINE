But, we are required to select the parts of the same object.We can select two or more parts to combine it into a single region, solid or surface.Consider the below image:Here, the two solids are selected to form a single solid.Let's understand with an example.Consider the below figure:The steps are listed below:1. Select Union icon form the ribbon panel.OrType Union on the command line press Enter.2. Select object 1 and object 2, as shown below:3. Press Enter.The combined object is shown below:SubtractThe Subtract command is used to subtract the selected 2D regions or 3D solids by the subtraction.Consider the below figure:Let's understand with an example.The steps are listed below:Select the Subtract icon from the ribbon panel.OrType Subtract on the command line or command prompt and press Enter.Select object 1.Press Enter.Select object 2.Press Enter.The object will now look like the below image:IntersectThe intersect command is used to create a 2D region or 3D solid formed by two overlapping regions or solids.Consider the below image:Let's understand with an example.The steps are listed below:Select the Intersect icon from the ribbon panel.OrType Intersect on the command line< press Enter.Select object 1 and object 2.Press Enter.The overlapping part of the remaining object is shown below:Next TopicAutoCAD to PDF? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
