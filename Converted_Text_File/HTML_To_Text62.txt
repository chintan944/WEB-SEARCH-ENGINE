Almost every company switched their services on the cloud to rise the company growth.Here, we are going to discuss some important advantages of Cloud Computing-1) Back-up and restore dataOnce the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.2) Improved collaborationCloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.3) Excellent accessibilityCloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world, using an internet connection. An internet cloud infrastructure increases organization productivity and efficiency by ensuring that our data is always accessible.4) Low maintenance costCloud computing reduces both hardware and software maintenance costs for organizations.5) MobilityCloud computing allows us to easily access all cloud data via mobile.6) IServices in the pay-per-use modelCloud computing offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the users for access services on the cloud and pays the charges as per the usage of service.7) Unlimited storage capacityCloud offers us a huge amount of storing capacity for storing our important data such as documents, images, audio, video, etc. in one place.8) Data securityData security is one of the biggest advantages of cloud computing. Cloud offers many advanced features related to security and ensures that data is securely stored and handled.Disadvantages of Cloud ComputingA list of the disadvantage of cloud computing is given below -1) Internet ConnectivityAs you know, in cloud computing, every data (image, audio, video, etc.) is stored on the cloud, and we access these data through the cloud by using the internet connection. If you do not have good internet connectivity, you cannot access these data. However, we have no any other way to access data from the cloud.2) Vendor lock-inVendor lock-in is the biggest disadvantage of cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different platforms, that can cause difficulty moving from one cloud to another.3) Limited ControlAs we know, cloud infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider, so the cloud users have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud infrastructure.4) SecurityAlthough cloud service providers implement the best security standards to store important information. But, before adopting cloud technology, you should be aware that you will be sending all your organization's sensitive information to a third party, i.e., a cloud computing service provider. While sending the data on the cloud, there may be a chance that your organization's information is hacked by Hackers.Next TopicHistory of Cloud Computing? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
