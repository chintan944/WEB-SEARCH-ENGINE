Resuscitation is a medical word which means "to revive".CPR is a life-saving technique used in medical emergencies such as heart attack or cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest may be caused by a heart condition, suffocation, drowning, electric shock, etc.This technique is a combination of chest compression and mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing. It helps restore blood circulation to the heart and brain until medical treatment is available; it delays the tissue death and damage to the brain. People who often handle emergencies like doctors, lifeguards, firefighters are trained in providing CPR.You don't need any special equipment to perform CPR. You just need to perform it in a proper sequence or order as described below:Chest compressionAirwayBreathingFurthermore, to perform CPR, you must ensure that the patient is in supine position (lying on his or her back on a firm surface). It makes CPR easy and effective as it allows the effective compression of the sternum. CPR on a soft surface like mattress is less effective. In addition to this, the person giving chest compressions should be positioned high enough so that he or she can properly compress the chest.Next TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
