Most of the programming languages contain built-in function 'split' to divide any string data into multiple parts. However, bash does not contain such type of built-in function. But we can use delimiters to split any string data in bash scripting. The delimiter can be either a single character or a string with multiple characters.Check out the methods below to understand how to split string in a bash shell:Split using $IFS variableFollowing are the steps to split a string in bash using $IFS:$IFS is a special internal variable which is used to split a string into words. $IFS variable is called 'Internal Field Separator' which determines how Bash recognizes boundaries. $IFS is used to assign the specific delimiter [ IFS='' ] for dividing the string. The white space is a default value of $IFS. However, we can also use values such as '\t', '\n', '-' etc. as the delimiter.After assigning the delimiter, a string can be read by two options: '-r' and '-a'. i.e., read -ra ARR "$str".Here, the option '-r' is used to define that backslash (\) is a character rather than escape character. The '-a' option is used to define that the words (separated by $IFS) are assigned to the sequential index of array beginning at zero.Then we apply bash 'for' loop to access the tokens which are split into an array.Let's understand this mechanism with the help of some examples:Example 1: Bash Split String by SpaceIn this example, a string is split using a space character delimiter.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Example for bash split string by space

read -p "Enter any string separated by space: " str  #reading string value

IFS='' #setting space as delimiter
read -ra ADDR "$str" #reading str as an array as tokens separated by IFS

for i in "${ADDR[@]}"; #accessing each element of array
do
echo "$i"
doneOutputIf we input a string "We welcome you on Javatpoint", the output will look like this:Example 2: Bash Split String by SymbolIn some cases, we may have a requirement to split a string by other delimiters such as a symbol or specific character. In this example, a string is split using a comma (,) symbol character as a delimiter.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Example for bash split string by Symbol (comma)

read -p "Enter Name, State and Age separated by a comma: " entry #reading string value

IFS=',' #setting comma as delimiter
read -a strarr "$entry" #reading str as an array as tokens separated by IFS

echo "Name : ${strarr[0]} "
echo "State : ${strarr[1]} "
echo "Age : ${strarr[2]}"OutputSplit without $IFS variableIn bash, a string can also be divided without using $IFS variable. The 'readarray' command with -d option is used to split the string data. The -d option is applied to define the separator character in the command like $IFS. Moreover, the bash loop is used to print the string in split form.Let's understand this logic with the help of some example:Example 1: Bash Split String by SymbolThis example defines how a string value can be split without using $IFS. As per the script, a text value should be entered with the colon (:) sign so that it can be split. Check out the bash script below:Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Example for bash split string without $IFS

read -p "Enter any string separated by colon(:) " str #reading string value

readarray -d : -t strarr "$str" #split a string based on the delimiter ':'

printf "\n"

#Print each value of Array with the help of loop
for (( n=0; n  ${#strarr[*]}; n++ ))
do
echo "${strarr[n]}"
doneOutputExample 2: Bash Split String by another stringIn this example, we have used idiomatic expressions where parameter expansion has completed.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Example for bash split string by another string

str="WeLearnWelcomeLearnYouLearnOnLearnJavatpoint"
delimiter=Learn
s=$str$delimiter
array=();
while [[ $s ]];
do
array+=( "${s%%"$delimiter"*}" );
s=${s#*"$delimiter"};
done;
declare -p arrayIn this bash script, we have used the following Parameter- Expansions:${parameter%%word}It removes the longest matching suffix pattern.${parameter#word}It removes the shortest matching prefix pattern.OutputExample 3: Bash Split String using Trim CommandIn this example, we have used trim (tr) command to split a string. Instead of using the read command, the trim command is used to split a string on the delimiter.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Example to split a string using trim (tr) command

my_str="We;welcome;you;on;javatpoint."
my_arr=($(echo $my_str | tr ";""\n"))

for i in "${my_arr[@]}"
do
echo $i
doneOutputNote: It should be noted that array elements are divided on 'space delimiter' if we apply a trim command to split a string. For example, elements like 'Windows OS' will be treated as two different words.ConclusionIn this topic, we demonstrated how to split a string in bash scripting with different types of scenarios with or without using delimiter.Next TopicBash Substring? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
