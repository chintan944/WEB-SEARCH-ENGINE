It is the measurement of energy expenditure of a person during physical, emotional and digestive rest over a 24-hour period. In other words, it is the amount of energy (calories) required by your body to maintain life or vital functions while you are resting at a comfortable temperature and not eating or digesting any food. BMR gives you an estimate of calories that you burn when you at complete rest for around 24 hours. The metabolic rate is usually less than BMR during sleep.How to Calculate BMR in HumansIn 1919, James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict introduced an equation/formula to calculate BMR of a person. This equation is known as Harris-Benedict equation. Later, in 1984, this equation was revised to be more accurate. In 1990, a new equation was introduced: the Miffin-St. jeor equation. It is still in use, this equation states:P= (10.0 x m/1 kg) + (6.25 x h/1cm) - (5.00 x a/1 year) + sP= total heat production while at rest (BMR)m= weight of a person in kilogramsh= height of a person in centimetersa= age of a person in yearss= constant (+5 for males and -161 for females)For example: let us calculate BMR of a 35 year old male who is 180 cm tall and weighs around 90 kg.On applying Formula:P= (10.0 x 90) + (6.25 x 180 cm) - (5.00 x 35) + 5= 900 + 1125 - 175 + 5= 2025 - 180= 1845So, this person burns 1845 calories while he is resting for 24 hours.Next TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
