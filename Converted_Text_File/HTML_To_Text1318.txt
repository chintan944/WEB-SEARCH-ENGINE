C4 is the resultant output carry generated by the last full-adder circuit.The output carry from each full-adder is connected to the input carry of the next-high-order full-adder.The sum outputs (S0 to S3) generates the required arithmetic sum of augend and addend bits.The n data bits for the A and B inputs come from different source registers. For instance, data bits for A input comes from source register R1 and data bits for B input comes from source register R2.The arithmetic sum of the data inputs of A and B can be transferred to a third register or to one of the source registers (R1 or R2).Next TopicBinary Adder-Subtractor? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
