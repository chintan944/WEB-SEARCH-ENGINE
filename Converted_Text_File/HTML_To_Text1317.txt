The 1's compliment can be implemented with inverters, and one can be added to the sum through the input carry.The Arithmetic micro-operations like addition and subtraction can be combined into one common circuit by including an exclusive-OR gate with each full adder.The block diagram for a 4-bit adder-subtractor circuit can be represented as:When the mode input (M) is at a low logic, i.e. '0', the circuit act as an adder and when the mode input is at a high logic, i.e. '1', the circuit act as a subtractor.The exclusive-OR gate connected in series receives input M and one of the inputs B.When M is at a low logic, we have B? 0 = B.The full-adders receive the value of B, the input carry is 0, and the circuit performs A plus B.When M is at a high logic, we have B? 1 = B' and C0 = 1.The B inputs are complemented, and a 1 is added through the input carry. The circuit performs the operation A plus the 2's complement of B.Next TopicBinary Incrementer? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
