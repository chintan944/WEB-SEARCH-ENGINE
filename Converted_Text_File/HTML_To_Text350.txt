This provides the ability to secure any secrets or sensitive data that is necessary to run Ansible plays successfully but should not be publicly visible, such as private keys or passwords. Ansible automatically decrypts the vault-encrypted content at runtime when the key is provided.To integrate these secrets with regular Ansible data, both the Ansible and Ansible-playbook commands, for executing ad hoc tasks and structured playbook respectively, have support for decrypting vault-encrypted content at runtime.Ansible Vault is implemented with file-level granularity; it means files are either entirely encrypted or unencrypted. It uses the AES256 algorithm to provide symmetric encryption keyed to a user-supplied password.This means the same password is used to encrypt and decrypt the content, which is helpful from a usability standpoint. Ansible can identify and decrypt any vault-encrypted files it finds while executing a task or playbook.Though there is a proposal to change this, at the time of writing this, users can only pass in a single password to Ansible. It means that each of the encrypted files involved must share a password.Using Ansible VaultThe simple use of the Ansible vault is to encrypt variables files. It can encrypt any YAML file, but the most common files to encrypt are:A role's defaults/ main.yml fileA role's vars/main.yml fileFiles within the group_vars directoryAny other file used to store variablesEncrypting an Existing FileYou can encrypt a regular plaintext variable file by using the ansible vault and define the password that needed later to decrypt it.#encrypt a role's defaults/main.yml file
ansible-vault encrypt defaults/main.yml
>New vault password: 
>Confirm new vault password:
>Encryption successful The ansible-vault command will prompt you a password twice. After that, the file will be encrypted.Creating an Encrypted FileTo create an encrypted data file, use the ansible-vault to create command, and pass the filename.$ansible-vault create <file name>You will be prompted to create a password and then confirm it by re-typing it.Once your password is confirmed, a new file will be created and will open an editing a window. By default, the editor for Ansible vault is VI. You can add data, save it, and exit from it.Editing Encrypted FilesIf you want to edit the encrypted file, you can edit it using ansible-vault edit command. This command will decrypt the file to a temporary file and allow you to edit the file.$ansible-vault edit <file name>You will be prompted to insert the vault password. The decrypted file will open in a VI editor, and then you can make the required changes. Save the changes and removing the temporary file.Rekeying Encrypted FilesIf you want to change your password on a vault on a vault-encrypted file, you can do it by using the rekey command.$ansible-vault rekey <file1> <file2> <file3>The above command can rekey multiple data files at once and ask for the original password and the new password.Encrypting Unencrypted FilesIf you have existing files which you want to encrypt, use the ansible-vault encrypt command. This command can operate on multiple files at once.$ansible-vault encrypt <file1> <file2> <file3>Decrypting Encrypted FilesIf you have existing files that you no longer want to keep encrypted, you can decrypt them permanently by running the ansible-vault decrypt command. This command will save them unencrypted to the disk.$ansible-vault decrypt <file1> <file2> <file3>Viewing Encrypted FilesIf you want to view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it, then you can use the ansible-vault view command.$ansible-vault view <file1> <file2> <file3>Next TopicAnsible Windows? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
