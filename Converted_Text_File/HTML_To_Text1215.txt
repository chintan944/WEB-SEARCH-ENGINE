Our Cassandra tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.Cassandra is a NoSQL database which is distributed and scalable. It is provided by Apache.Our Cassandra tutorial includes all topics of Cassandra such as features, architecture, Relational vs NoSQL, Cassandra vs HBase, installation, Keyspace, Table, Views, Cassandra Query Language, Security etc.What is CassandraApache Cassandra is highly scalable, high performance, distributed NoSQL database. Cassandra is designed to handle huge amount of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability without a single point of failure.Cassandra has a distributed architecture which is capable to handle a huge amount of data. Data is placed on different machines with more than one replication factor to attain a high availability without a single point of failure.Cassandra is a NoSQL databaseNoSQL database is Non-relational database. It is also called Not Only SQL. It is a database that provides a mechanism to store and retrieve data other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. These databases are schema-free, support easy replication, have simple API, eventually consistent, and can handle huge amounts of data.Reasons behind its popularityCassandra is an Apache product. It is an open source, distributed and decentralized/distributed storage system (database). It is used to manage very large amounts of structured data spread out across the world. It provides high availability with no single point of failure.Important Points of CassandraCassandra is a column-oriented database.Cassandra is scalable, consistent, and fault-tolerant.Cassandra's distribution design is based on Amazon's Dynamo and its data model on Google's Bigtable.Cassandra is created at Facebook. It is totally different from relational database management systems.Cassandra follows a Dynamo-style replication model with no single point of failure, but adds a more powerful "column family" data model.Cassandra is being used by some of the biggest companies like Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, Rackspace, ebay, Twitter, Netflix, and more.Cassandra IndexCassandra TutorialCassandra TutorialCassandra HistoryCassandra FeaturesCassandra ArchitectureRelational vs NoSQLCassandra Use CasesCassandra Data TypesCassandra Data ModelCassandra vs HBaseCassandra vs RDBMSCassandra InstallationCassandra CqlshCassandra KeyspaceCreate KeyspaceAlter KeyspaceDrop KeyspaceCassandra Table IndexCreate TableAlter TableDrop TableTruncate TableCreate IndexDrop IndexCassandra BatchCassandra Query (CQL)CQL Create DataCQL Read DataCQL Update DataCQL Delete DataCassandra CollectionsCassandra CollectiionsInterview QuestionsCassandra Interview QuestionsPrerequisiteBefore learning Cassandra, you must have the basic knowledge of SQL.AudienceOur Cassandra tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.ProblemWe assure that you will not find any problem in this Cassandra programming tutorial.
