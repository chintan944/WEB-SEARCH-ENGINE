You have to determine whether each statement is correct. If both the statements are correct, you have to determine whether the reason supports the assertion. There will be four answer choices for the possible outcomes and you have to select the correct one.1) Assertion (A): James Watt invented the steam engine.Reason (R): It was invented to pump out the water from the flooded mines.Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.A is true, but R is false.A is false, but R is true.Both A and R are false.Show Answer WorkspaceAnswer: AExplanation:The need of self-working engine to pump out the water from the flooded mines led James Watt to invent the steam engine.2) Assertion (A): Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would melt the polar ice.Reason (R): Increased levels of carbon dioxide would increase the temperature.Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.A is true, but R is false.A is false, but R is true.Both A and R are false.Show Answer WorkspaceAnswer: AExplanation:The carbon dioxide traps the heat in the atmosphere. If its level rises, more heat will be trapped. It would increase the temperature and eventually the polar ice would melt.3) Assertion (A): Uranium can undergo a nuclear fusion reaction.Reason (R): Uranium has a big unstable nucleus.Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.A is true, but R is false.A is false, but R is true.Both A and R are false.Show Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DExplanation:Uranium does not undergo a fusion reaction. It undergoes fission reaction due to the presence of a heavy unstable nucleus.4) Assertion (A): Baking soda helps reduce stomach acidity.Reason (R): It is a powerful natural cleaner.Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.A is true, but R is false.A is false, but R is true.Both A and R are false.Show Answer WorkspaceAnswer: BExplanation:Baking soda is alkaline in nature, so it helps reduce stomach acidity. It is also used as a cleaning agent.5) Assertion (A): Plants have green leaves.Reason (R): Plants contain phycoerythrin, the green pigment.Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.A is true, but R is false.A is false, but R is true.Both A and R are false.Show Answer WorkspaceAnswer: CExplanation:Plants have green leaves due to the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll.
