Azure Backup replaces our existing on-premises or off-site backup solution with a cloud-based solution that is reliable, secure, and cost-competitive. It is not only used as cloud storage to back-up our data to the cloud, but we can also use our existing local disc to back-up the data.So, Azure backup works with this heterogeneous storage environment with the combination of on-premises storage and also cloud storage. Whenever Azure backup uses local storage, we'll not get charged for it. You will only get charged when the data is backed up in the cloud.Advantages of Azure BackupAutomatic storage managementUnlimited scalingMultiple Storage optionsApplication consistent backupLong-Term retentionWorking of Azure backup serviceThe first thing we do when we're using Azure backup is to define backup policy. The policy describes how frequently you need to take a backup and also which target you need to backup. After that, we also identify the destination where the data need to get stored, which in most cases, it's going to be recovery services vault. Backup of the data will not get stored in a storage account, and it will be stored in the recovery service vault, which is also an online storage facility where we can save the backup of all our virtual machines.Components of Azure Backup serviceComponentWhat is protected?Backup storageBackup frequencyAzure Backup agentFiles, Folders, System State Windows only.Recovery service vaultThree backups per daySystem Center DPMFiles, Folders, Volumes, VMs, Applications, WorkloadsRecovery service vault, Local disk, TapeTwo backups per day to RSV, Every 15 minutes for SQL Server, Every hour for other workloadsAzure Backup ServerFiles, Folders, Volumes, VMs, Applications, WorkloadsRecovery service vault, Local diskTwo backups per day to RSV, Every 15 minutes for SQL Server, Every hour for other workloadsAzure IaaS VM BackupVMs, All disks Windows and LinuxRecovery service vaultOne backup per dayHow to take the backup of VM using the Azure backupStep 1: Go into Virtual Machine and click on Backup.
