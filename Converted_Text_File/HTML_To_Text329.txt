It was the foundation on which Ansible Tower was created.Ansible AWX is a development branch of code that only undergoes minimal testing and quality engineering testing. There are some drawbacks to enterprise adoption, which is the lack of signed images for using it in the enterprise, lack of real versioning being present with upgrades, and support being offered.AWX is a web-based solution that makes Ansible more comfortable to use for IT teams. It is designed to be the hub for all automation tasks. It has a fantastic browser REST API and allows you to control access, graphically manage or sync inventory with a wide variety of cloud sources, log all your jobs, and integrate well with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).Ansible Tower is a commercial version based on AWX by Red Hat. Ansible AWX and Ansible Tower both have similar features.Ansible is planning on continuing to mature the product lifecycle of Ansible AWX so that it is in tighter lock-step with Ansible Tower releases.The most significant benefit of AWX over Ansible Tower is that you have all of the enterprise features for an unlimited number of nodes. And one of the significant differences you will see between AWX and Ansible Tower is a different logo for the products.Ansible AWX Prerequisites2 or 3 serversAnsible version 2.4+10.5.5.20 Ansible AWX10.5.5.21 lempDockerDocker python moduleGit version 1.8.4+Node 10.x LTS versionNPM 6.x LTSRoot privilegesSystem Requirements for AWX4 GB of RAM3.4 GHz CPU with 2 Cores20 GB of hard disk spaceRunning Docker, Openshift, or KubernetesAWX InstallationHere are some steps to deploy and run the Ansible playbook for the basic LEMP installation through the Ansible AWX dashboard, such as:Step 1: Install EPEL on CentOS 8It provides some of the quintessential packages required by AWX. Therefore, login as a root user to your CentOS 8 node and run the command:[root@awx-ansible~] #dnf install epel-release-yStep 2: Install additional packages and dependenciesWe need to install essential packages that will be required as we get along with the installation of AWX[root@awx-ansible~] #dnf install git gcc gcc-c++ nodejs gettext device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 bzip2 python3-pipStep 3: Install Docker CE on CentOS 8To install Docker on CentOS 8, we need to append the Docker repository to the system using the dnf config-manager tool.[root@awx-ansible~] #dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repoTo install the Docker, run the below command:[root@awx-ansible~] #dnf install docker-ce-3:18.09.1-3.e17Run the below command to know what exact version of Docker installed.[root@awx-ansible~] #rpm-qa|grep dockerOr[root@awx-ansible~] #docker --version Proceed to start and enable Docker using the below commands:[root@awx-ansible~] #systemct1 start docker
[root@awx-ansible~] #systemct1 enable --now docker.serviceStep 4: Install Docker-Compose on CentOS 8To installation of docker-compose, we will use the pip3 since the system is running using python3.[root@awx-ansible~] #pip3 install docker-composeStep 5: Install Ansible AWXTo install Ansible AWX, first clone the repo as shown below:[root@awx-ansible~] #git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.gitWe need to configure the admin & Postgres passwordpg_admin_password=postgrespass@789
admin_password=Linuxtechi@789Therefore, sure to generate a cryptographic key for encryption of the inventory file[root@awx-ansible~] #openssl rand -base64 30Copy the secret key and append it to the secret_key entry in the inventory file. Save and exit from the inventory file.To install the Ansible AWX run the following command:[root@awx-ansible installer] # ansible-playbook -i inventory install.ymlAfter installation is done, you can check the containers which are launched via docker-compose.[root@awx-ansible installer] #docker psStep 6: Accessing AWX GUI portalTo access AWX web console, open the browser and type in your Ansible AWX server IP and press ENTER.Provide the username and password for admin and press ENTER. It displays an AWX dashboard to you.Next TopicAnsible Unarchive? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
