It is a measure to classify people under the following categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. It is the ratio of your weight in kilograms to the square of your height in meters. People with high BMI have too much body weight or body fat for their height.BMI gives you a rough estimate of your overall fitness and possibility of developing chronic diseases like heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, gallstones etc. A highly muscular person may have a high BMI without any health risk. BMI was introduced in the 1830s by Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician. It is also known as Quetelet index.BMI Categories:BMI =< 18.5 indicates UnderweightBMI = 18.5-24.9 indicates Normal weightBMI = 25-29.9 indicates OverweightBMI = 30-34.9 indicates ObesityBMI= 35-39.9 indicates severely obeseBMI > 40 indicates morbid obesityHow to calculate BMITo calculate BMI, you are required to have two values: a person's height in meters and his weight in kilograms. If the height is in inches, weight should be in pounds. The formula to calculate BMI is as follows:BMI = weight in kilograms / (height in meters) 2OrBMI = weight in pounds / (height in inches) 2 X 703 (if pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703 must be applied).Let us see an example:A person with height 2 meters and weight 80 Kg will have BMI = 20, as calculated below:BMI = 80 kg / (2)2 meter= 80 / 4 = 20 (normal weight)Or1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds1 meter = 39.37 inchesSo, weight in pounds of this person= 80 x 2.2 = 176 poundsSimilarly, height in inches of this person = 2 x 39.37 = 78.74 inchesBMI = 176 pounds / (78.74)2 inches x 703=176 / 6200 x 703= 20 / 6199 = 20 (normal weight)Next TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
