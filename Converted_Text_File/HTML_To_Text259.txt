Because both operating systems cover so much area and many features to explore. Android and iOS perform most of the same task anyway, and mostly in the same way too.Android vs. iPhone: basicGoogle developed android. It provides its own Pixel tasteful version on its Pixel phones, and others such as Samsung, Huawei, LG, etc. have added their own skins on top of their own hardware.iOS is Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It has evolved in association with hardware, so Apple does not have to worry about making the code fit for hundreds of different devices from a dozen different manufacturers.In summary, both are very similar. Both let you take photos, send messages, make calls, and run hundreds of apps to chat with friends, watch movies, manage your calendar, read up on the news, and so on.There are lots of other issues which are used to differentiate Android from iPhone, like widgets or notifications. There are still some other key differences, though, which we will see here.Android vs. iPhone: hardwareOne of the biggest advantages of Android in terms of hardware is that you will get so many different phones to pick. The Pixel 3, the Samsung Galaxy series, the Huawei P30 Pro. If you go for Android, then you will get a lot of manufacturers and models for your business.With the iPhone and iOS, you will get a range which can be split into two. On the one hand, there are iPhone 7 and 8 with the traditional home button. On the other hand, you will get more expensive iPhone XR, X, XS, XS Max, 11, 11 pro, and 11 max pro.Android vs. iPhone: featuresAs we discussed earlier, most of the features are the same between Android and iOS. Broadly speaking, there are a few key differences between them.Android is more customizable; for example, if you do not like the default web browser, SMS app, you can change it. You can leave gaps in the rows of icons. You can absolutely transform Android with a launcher app which you cannot do any of that with Apple's iPhone.The iOS and iPhone provide a more polished and secure experience. They don't have any security issues as Android can have sometimes (not always).Android vs. iPhone: appsYou can found the most popular apps on both Android and the iPhone nowadays. There are not many major parts of software that runs on one platform and not the other.Many new apps (or app updates) often arrive on iOS first, especially games. A recent example of it is Alto's Odyssey. You might have to wait a little longer for Android.Android vs. iPhone: battery lifeThe early iPhone requires recharging their batteries every day. The recent models can go a day without a charge through new versions of the operating system, which tend to cut battery life.The battery life is more complex in Android due to the larger hardware manufacturers options. Some Android model has a 7-inch display and other features which burns more battery life.Thanks to the wide range of Android models, there are also other features like ultra-high capacity batteries. So, if we talk about batteries life, Android can deliver a device which works much longer than an iPhone on a single charge.Android vs. iPhone: intelligent assistantThe next features and functionality will be driven by artificial intelligence and voice interfaces. In this context, Android has a clear lead.Google Assistant is the most outstanding artificial intelligence assistant on Android, is extremely powerful. Google Assistant uses everything Google knows about you, and it makes your life easier. For example, if your Google Calendar knows that your meeting is scheduled at 10:00 and the traffic is terrible, Google Assistant can send a notification telling you to leave early.Siri is Apple's artificial intelligence, and it is improving continuously with each new iOS release. Siri is still limited to fairly simple tasks and does not provide an advance smart of Google Assistant. Google Assistant is also available for the iPhone.Android vs. iOS: comparison chartAndroidiOSDeveloperGoogle, Open handset AllianceApple Inc.Initial releaseSeptember 23, 2008July 29, 2007First versionIt has Android 1.0, AlphaIt has iPhone OS 1, before named iOSLatest stable release and updatesAndroid 10 (September 3, 2019)iOS 13.2.3 and iPAd 13.2.3 (November 18,2019)Working statusCurrentCurrentSource modelAndroid has Open sourceIt has Closed, with open source components.File transferUsing the USB port and Android File Transfer desktop app. The photo can also be transferred via USB without apps.
