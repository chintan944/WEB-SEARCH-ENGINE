But they don't refer to the same thing as they are different from each other in terms of their taste, consistency, preparation etc. Let us see how they differ from each other!Broth:Broth refers to a liquid or water in which a meat has been cooked with one or more other ingredients. It is mainly made by simmering meat and bones with herbs and mirepoix (a mix of carrots, celery and onions) for a short period of time. A broth has a subtle taste and is ready to consume and can be used for a variety of soups and side dishes.It is not only a wonderful base for soups but also suitable for adding flavor to side dishes like stuffing, rice, mashed potatoes, pasta and vegetables, i.e. it can be used as cooking liquid instead of water to make dishes more delicious and healthy. You can also sip warm broth when feeling cold or feeling a little under the weather.So, you can drink broth by itself or use it for soups and side dishes due to its balanced and subtle flavour that don't dominate other ingredients and enhances the taste of rice, potatoes, vegetables etc. Broth can be made from any type of meat but the most common flavours of broth are chicken, beef and vegetable.Stock:The stock is a flavourful liquid that is used in sauces and soups. Its main role is to provide body to the dishes rather than flavor. It is made with bones in addition to a mirepoix which is a mixture of onions, carrots and celery. Stock has a thick, gelatinous consistency as the bones and cartilage release collagen and gelatin into the liquid while it is cooked.A stock can be made from different bones such as chicken, beef, pork, fish etc. It is not supposed to consume by itself rather it is prepared to be used as an ingredient or it needs some additional ingredients or further cooking to make it suitable for eating.Based on the above information, some of the key differences between broth and stock are as follows:BrothStockIt is a liquid in which meat has been cooked.It is made with bones and mirepoix.It is made with meat, bones may be included.It is made with bones rather than meat.You can drink broth by itself as it is tasty and flavorful.It is not supposed to drink by itself.
