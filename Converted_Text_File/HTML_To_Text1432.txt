It is also called as deformation. Change can be in the x -direction or y -direction or both directions in case of 2D. If shear occurs in both directions, the object will be distorted. But in 3D shear can occur in three directions.Matrix for shearNext TopicHidden Surface Removal? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
