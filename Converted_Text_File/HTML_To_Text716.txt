It is a manufacturing and engineering program that is designed for PCs, and Mac. It is considered as the next generation tool for the next generation platform.We can unify design, engineering, and manufacturing into a single platform.The Fusion 360 is a cloud-enabled collaboration platform that enables designers to instantly share, review project data, and share ideas on any device at any time. It is a 3D CAM application with reform and solid modeling tools seamlessly embraced into one application.It is a 3D animation, simulation, and rendering application. It is the first cloud-enabled tool to provide 2D drawing capability.PriceUsesFeatures of AutoCAD Fusion 360The features of Fusion 360 are listed below:It has a modernistic look and an easier learning curve.DesignsIt includes various design interactions. The environment combines multiple modelling methods, such as Sketching, Freeform Modelling, Surface Modelling, Parametric Modelling, Mesh Modelling, Direct Modelling, and PCB Design Integration.It thus creates the flexibility to create high-quality products.3D modelling includes Sheet Modelling, Mesh Modelling, and Assemblies.AnyCADThe AnyCAD software eliminates the need for translation. We can use data and models from any tool directly in our 360 Fusion design.Cloud StorageIt is a cloud-based platform. It signifies that we can access our data anywhere on any device. We can continue our work without the Internet connection using the offline mode.Version ControlIt reduces workflow efficiencies and design cycle errors.It tracks every change and thus prevents conflicts with automated, built-in version management.It includes many file formats such as STEP, DWG, STL, IGES, OBJ, etc.Administrative toolsIt grants rights and assign permission to stakeholders inside or outside our organization with a collection of advanced administrative tools.CAMThe toolpaths get updated with every design change through our fully integrated manufacturing tools. It thus makes it quick and easy to machine prototypes.RenderingIt creates photo-realistic images of our model leveraging local or cloud rendering.It defines project objective, generates and explores designs, Export-CAD ready files, etcUsing cloud credits, we can simultaneously solve for various design outcomes.We can communicate our designs to external or internal stakeholders with rendering, 2D manufacturing drawings, and animations.SimulationIt determines and analyzes the Static Stress, Modal Frequency, Thermal Stress, Non-linear stress, Buckling (prediction of unexpected failure modes), Event simulation, and Shape Optimization.Next TopicAutoCAD 2019? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
