In general this mode used for saving the operational power requirement of microcontroller.Idle Mode: It stops the functioning of CPU, but allows operation of ADC, TWI, SPI, and interrupts system and Watchdog. It is achieved by setting SM0 to SM2 bits of Microcontroller Unit register flag at zero.Power down Mode: It enables external interrupts, the 2-wire serial interface, and watchdog while disabling the external oscillator. It stops all generated clocks.ADC Noise Reduction Mode: It stops the central processing unit but allows the functioning of ADC, timer/counter and external interrupts.Stand By mode: In this mode, only oscillator is allowed to operate by slowing all other operation of microcontroller.Next TopicAVR I/O Port Programming? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
