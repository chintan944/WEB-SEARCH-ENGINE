There is a total of 80 character positions on each line of a coding sheet.Character positions are grouped into the following sections:PositionsFieldDescription1-6Columns NumbersUsed for the line number for counting lines of code.7IndicatorIt can have (*, -, /). Asterisk(*) is used for comments, Hyphen(-) indicates continuation, slash (/) indicate form feed.8-11Area AAll COBOL divisions, paragraphs, sections, and some special entries must begin in Area A.12-72Area BAll COBOL statements must begin in Area B.73-80Identification AreaThis is used for the identification of each line in the code. The programmer can use it as per their needs.ExampleLet's see the example given below, showing a COBOL coding sheet:When you compile and execute the code, it will display the following output:Character SetCharacters are the lowest in the COBOL hierarchy, and they cannot be further divided. The following COBOL characters are given below:S.

A character string can be a:CommentLiteralCOBOL WordCommentA comment is called a character string that does not affect the execution of a program. It can be any combination of characters.There are two types of comments:Comment LineWe can write the comment line in any column. The compiler does not check a comment line for syntax and use it for documentation.Comment EntryComment entries are those, which are integrated into the optional paragraphs of an identification Division. They are written in Area B, and programmers make use of it for reference.Let's see one example for types of comments:000100 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.                                         000100
000200 PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.                                               000101
000300 AUTHOR.  JavaTpoint                                              000102
000400* THIS IS A COMMENT LINE                                          000103
000500 PROCEDURE DIVISION.                                              000104
000600 A000-FIRST-PARA.                                                 000105
000700/ First Para Begins - Documentation Purpose                       000106
000800     DISPLAY "Comments".                                          000107
000900 STOP RUN.                                                        000108It will look like this in your OpenCobolIDE editor.When you compile and execute the above program, it will display the following output:LiteralsLiteral is a constant, which we can directly enter in a program. There are two types of literals as given below:Alphanumeric LiteralAlphanumeric Literals are enclosed in an apostrophe. Length can be up to 160 characters. The beginning and ending of a literal should be the same, either quote or apostrophe.ValidInvalid'It is valid''It is not valid""It is valid""It is not valid''It doesn' 't invalid''It doesn't valid'Numeric LiteralIt is a combination of numeric digits from 0 to 9, +, -, or decimal point. Length can be up to 18 characters.+, - sign cannot be the rightmost character. And decimal point (.) should not appear at the end.ValidInvalid2002,00+15.915.-3.93.9-COBOL WordCOBOL word is a character string that can be a user-defined word or a reserved word.User-DefinedUser-defined words are used to give a name to a file, data, records, paragraphs, and sections. Digits, alphabets, and hyphens are allowed while forming user-defined words. You cannot use COBOL reserved words.Reserved WordsIn COBOL, reserved words are predefined words. Some common reserved words are:Keywords - e.g., ADD, MOVE, ACCEPT, etc.Special Characters - e.g., +, - *, , =, etc.Figurative Constants - these are the constant values like ZERO, SPACES, etc. Some Figurative Constants are HIGH VALUES, LOW VALUES, ZERO, SPACES, QUOTES, All literals.Next TopicCOBOL Divisions? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
