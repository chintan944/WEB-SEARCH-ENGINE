The sliding of layers of object occur. The shear can be in one direction or in two directions.Shearing in the X-direction: In this horizontal shearing sliding of layers occur. The homogeneous matrix for shearing in the x-direction is shown below:Shearing in the Y-direction: Here shearing is done by sliding along vertical or y-axis.Shearing in X-Y directions: Here layers will be slided in both x as well as y direction. The sliding will be in horizontal as well as vertical direction. The shape of the object will be distorted. The matrix of shear in both directions is given by:Next TopicMatrix Representation? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
