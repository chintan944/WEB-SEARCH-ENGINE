Some of the important methods are given below (Assuming, name of the file that we are reading is 'read_file.txt'):Reading File Using 'cat fileName'We can use the following syntax to take a print of the contents of the file to a terminal.value=`cat file_name`Example#!/bin/bash

value=`cat read_file.txt`
echo "$value"OutputReading File Using '$(<fileName>)Following is the syntax to read the content of the file using '$'value=$(file_name)Example#!/bin/bash

value=$(textarea>OutputReading File Content from Command-lineIf we want to read a file line by line from commands-line without using the 'cat' command, we can run the following command to perform a task:Commandwhile read line; do Command; done  input.fileOutputHere, while loop will reach each line of the file and store the content of the line in $line variable which will be printed later.Reading File Content Using ScriptTo read the file content using the script, we need to create a bash file and add the following code:Bash Script#!/bin/bash

file='read_file.txt'

i=1
while read line; do

#Reading each line
echo "Line No. $i : $line"
i=$((i+1))
done  $fileOutputHere, an existing filename is stored in $file variable, and $i variable is used to keep the value of the line number of that line.Passing filename from Command line and reading the FileCreate a bash and add the following script which will pass filename from the command line and read the file line by line. The first argument value is read by the variable $1, which will include the filename for reading. If the file is available in the specified location then while loop will read the file line by line and print the file content.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

file=$1
while read line; do

#Readind each line in sequence
echo $line
done OutputHere, the filename is used as an argument value. The output will provide the content of 'read_file.txt' with no extra spaces between words.Reading file by omitting Backslash EscapeIf we want to read each line of a file line by line by omitting backslash-escape then we are required to use the '-r' option with a 'read' command in 'while' loop, e.g.:Bash Script#!/bin/bash

while read -r line; do

#Reading each line by omitting backslash escape
echo $line
done  read_file.txtOutputWe may require reading the file for several programming purposes. For example, we can search or match any specific content easily from the file line by line. Hence, it is a useful task for any programming language.Next TopicBash Write File? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
