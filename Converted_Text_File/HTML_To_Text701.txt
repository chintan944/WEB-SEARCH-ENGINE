The steps are listed below:Click on the Circle icon on the Ribbon Panel, as shown in the below image:ORType Circle or C on the command line and press Enter.Specify the center point of a circle on the workspace or viewport.Specify the endpoint of the radius through the cursor.Types of CirclesThere are three types of circles, which are listed below:2 point circle3 point circleTangent circle1) 2 Point circleWe can create a circle by specifying the two endpoints.The distance between the two specified endpoints will be considered as the diameter of that circle.Let's understand with an example.Example: A circle between two lines.The steps to create a two-point circle are listed below:Select the 2-Point circle option from the drop-down list of the circle, as shown in the below image:OrType C or Circle on the command line - Press Enter- type 2P - press Enter.Click on the first endpoint of a circle diameter. We can also type the value to specify the endpoint.Click on the second endpoint of a circle diameter through the cursor, as shown in the below image:We can specify the endpoints according to the requirements.The circle will be created, as shown in the below image:2) 3 Point circleWe can create a circle by specifying the three endpoints.Let's understand with an example.Example: A circle between three edges.The steps to create a three-point circle are listed below:Create three edges.Select the 3-Point circle option from the drop-down list of the circle, as shown in the below image:OrType C or Circle on the command line - Press Enter- type 3P - press Enter.Click on the first point.Click on the second point.Click on the third point.The three points are shown in the below image:The circle will be drawn, as shown in the below image:Tangent circleThe tangent circle command is used to draw circles on the tangent.There are two types of the tangent circle, that appear on the drop-down list of the circle icon on the ribbon panel, as shown in the below image:Let's understand with three examples.Example 1: Tan, Tan, RadiusThe steps to create a Ttr (Tangent tangent radius) circle are listed below:Draw two lines in the viewport, as shown in the below image:Select the Tan, Tan, Radius circle option from the drop-down list of the circle on the ribbon panel.OrType C or Circle on the command line - Press Enter- type ttr - press Enter.Click on the first point on the first tangent.Click on the second point on the other tangent.Specify the radius of the circle. For example, 4.The circle will be drawn on the two tangents, as shown in the below image:The circle will be adjusted according to the specified radius.Example 2: Tan, Tan, TanThe steps to create a (Tangent tangent tangent) circle are listed below:Draw three lines on the viewport, as shown in the below image:Select the Tan, Tan, Tan circle option from the drop-down list of the circle.Click on the first point on the first tangent.Click on the second point on the second tangent.Click on the third point on the third tangent.The circle will be drawn on the three tangents, as shown in the below image:We can modify the tangent and points according to the requirements.Example 3: Tan, Tan, RadiusTo create a circle inside a triangleThe steps to create a circle inside a triangle are listed below:Draw a triangle in the viewport, as shown in the below image:Select the Tan, Tan, Radius circle option from the drop-down list of the circle. OrType C or Circle on the command line - Press Enter- type ttr - press Enter.Click on the first point on one side of the triangle.Click on the second and third points on the other side of the triangle.The circle will be drawn inside the circle, as shown in the below image:Next TopicEllipse in AutoCAD? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
