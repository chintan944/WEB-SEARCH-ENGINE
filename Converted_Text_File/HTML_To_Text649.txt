Here, we are discussing these features of Web Forms.Server ControlsMaster PagesWorking with dataMembershipClient Script and Client FrameworksRoutingState ManagementSecurityPerformanceError HandlingServer ControlsWeb Forms provides rich set of server controls. These controls are objects that run when the page is requested and render markup to the browser. Some Web server controls are similar to familiar HTML elements, such as buttons and text boxes. It also provides controls that we can use to connect to data sources and display data.Master PagesIt allowsus to create a consistent layout for the pages in our application. This page defines the look and feel and standard behavior that we want for all of the pages in our application. When users request the content pages, they merge with the master page to produce output that combines the layout of the master page with the content from the content page.Working with DataIn an ASP.NET Web Forms application, we use data-bound controls to automate the presentation or input of data in web page UI elements such as tables and text boxes and drop-down lists.MembershipProject's Account folder contains the files that implement the various parts of membership: registering, logging in, changing a password, and authorizing access. Additionally, ASP.NET Web Forms supports OAuth and OpenID. These authentication enhancements allow users to log into your site using existing credentials, from such accounts as Facebook, Twitter and Google.Client Script and Client FrameworksWe can enhance the server-based features of ASP.NET by including client-script functionality in ASP.NET Web Form pages. We can use client script to provide a richer, more responsive user interface to the users. We can also use client script to make asynchronous calls to the Web server while a page is running in the browser.RoutingWe can configure URL routing of our application. A request URL is simply the URL a user enters into their browser to find a page on our web site. We use routing to define URLs that are semantically meaningful to users and that can help with search-engine optimization (SEO).State ManagementASP.NET Web Forms includes several options that help you preserve data on both a per-page basis and an application-wide basis.SecurityDeveloping a secure application is most important aspect of software development process. ASP.NET Web Forms allow us to add extensibility points and configuration options that enable us to customize various security behaviors in the application.PerformanceWeb Forms provides good performance and allows us to modify performance related to page and server control processing, state management, data access, application configuration and loading, and efficient coding practices.Debugging and Error HandlingWe can diagnose problems that occur in our Web Forms application. Debugging and error handling are well supported within ASP.NET Web Forms so that our applications compile and run effectively.Next TopicASP.NET WF Project? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
