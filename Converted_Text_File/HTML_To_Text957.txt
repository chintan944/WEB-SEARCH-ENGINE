It is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is a combination of a set of characters that may also contain numbers.For example, the word "javatpoint" and the phrase "Welcome to javatpoint" are the strings. Even "01234" could be considered as a string, if specified correctly. Programmers are required to enclose strings in quotation marks for the data to be considered as a string and not a number, variable name or array, etc.Bash consists of multiple ways to perform string operations and manipulate them.Following are some operators in Shell Script used to perform string operations:Equal OperatorAn equal operator (=) is used to check whether two strings are equal.SyntaxOperand1 = Operand2Example#!/bin/bash
#Script to check whether two strings are equal.

str1="WelcometoJavatpoint."
str2="javatpoint"

if [ $str1 = $str2 ];
then
echo "Both the strings are equal."
else
echo "Strings are not equal."
fiOutputStrings are not equal.Not Equal OperatorNot equal operator (!=) is used to define that strings are not equal.SyntaxOperand1 != Operand2Example#!/bin/bash
#Script to check whether two strings are equal.

str1="WelcometoJavatpoint."
str2="javatpoint"

if [[ $str1 != $str2 ]];
then
echo "Strings are not equal."
else
echo "Strings are equal."
fiOutputStrings are not equal.Less than OperatorThe 'less than operator (\)' is a conditional operator which is used to check if string1 is less than string2.SyntaxOperand1 \ Operand2Example#!/bin/sh 

str1="WelcometoJavatpoint"
str2="Javatpoint"
if [ $str1 \ $str2 ];
then 
	echo "$str1 is less then $str2"
else
	echo "$str1 is not less then $str2"
fiOutputWelcometoJavatpoint is not less then JavatpointGreater than OperatorThe 'greater than operator (\>)` is used to check if string1 is greater than string2.SyntaxOperand1 \> Operand2Example#!/bin/sh 

str1="WelcometoJavatpoint"
str2="Javatpoint"
if [ $str1 \> $str2 ];
then 
	echo "$str1 is greater then $str2"
else
	echo "$str1 is less then $str2"
fiOutputWelcometoJavatpoint is greater then JavatpointTo check if the string length is greater than Zero:This operator is used to check if the string is zero or greater than zero.Syntax[ -n Operand ]Example#!/bin/sh 

str="WelcometoJavatpoint"

if [ -n $str ];
then 
	echo "String is not empty"
else
	echo "String is empty"
fi OutputString is not emptyTo check if the string length is equal to ZeroThis operator is used to check if the string is empty or equal to zero.Syntax[ -z Operand ]Example#!/bin/sh 

str=""

if [ -z $str ];
then 
	echo "String is empty."
else
	echo "String is non-empty."
fi OutputString is emptyConclusionIn this topic, we have learned about the syntax of different operators in bash scripting with example scripts.Next TopicBash Find String? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
