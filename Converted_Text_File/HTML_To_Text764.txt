The input tape is having an infinite number of cells, each cell containing one input symbol and thus the input string can be placed on tape. The empty tape is filled by blank characters.2. The finite control and the tape head which is responsible for reading the current input symbol. The tape head can move to left to right.3. A finite set of states through which machine has to undergo.4. Finite set of symbols called external symbols which are used in building the logic of turing machine.Next TopicLanguage accepted by Turing machine? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
