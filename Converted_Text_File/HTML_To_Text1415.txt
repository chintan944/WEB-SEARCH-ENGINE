Where the responsibility of object may vary from time to time.UML for Composite PatternElements used in Composite Pattern:Let's see the 4 elements of composte pattern.1) ComponentDeclares interface for objects in composition.Implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes as appropriate.Declares an interface for accessing and managing its child components.2) LeafRepresents leaf objects in composition. A leaf has no children.Defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.3) CompositeDefines behavior for components having children.Stores child component.Implements child related operations in the component interface.4) ClientManipulates objects in the composition through the component interface.Note:The work flow of above general UML is as follows.Client uses the component class interface to interact with objects in the composition structure. If recipient is the leaf then request will be handled directly. If recipient is a composite, then it usually forwards the request to its child for performing the additional operations.Example of Composite PatternWe can easily understand the example of composite design pattern by the UML diagram given below:Implementation of above UML:Step 1Create an Employee interface that will be treated as a component.// this is the Employee interface i.e. Component.
public interface Employee {
	public  int getId();
	public String getName();
	public double getSalary();
       public void print();
	public void add(Employee employee);
       public void remove(Employee employee);
       public Employee getChild(int i);
}// End of the Employee interface.Step 2Create a BankManager class that will be treated as a Composite and implements Employee interface.File: BankManager.java// this is the BankManager class i.e. Composite.
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
public class BankManager implements Employee {
	 private int id;
	 private String name;
	 private double salary;

	 public BankManager(int id,String name,double salary) {
	  this.id=id;	 
	  this.name = name;
	  this.salary = salary;
	 }
         List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Employee>();
	 @Override
	 public void add(Employee employee) {
	    employees.add(employee);
	 }
        @Override
	 public Employee getChild(int i) {
	  return employees.get(i);
	 }
	 @Override
	 public void remove(Employee employee) {
	  employees.remove(employee);
	 }	
	 @Override
	 public int getId()  {
	  return id;
	 }
	 @Override
	 public String getName() {
	  return name;
	 }
    @Override
	 public double getSalary() {
	  return salary;
	 }
	 @Override
	 public void print() {
	  System.out.println("==========================");
	  System.out.println("Id ="+getId());
	  System.out.println("Name ="+getName());
	  System.out.println("Salary ="+getSalary());
	  System.out.println("==========================");
	  
	  Iterator<Employee> it = employees.iterator();
	  
	      while(it.hasNext())  {
	        Employee employee = it.next();
	        employee.print();
	     }
	 }
}// End of the BankManager class.Step 3Create a Cashier class that will be treated as a leaf and it will implement to the Employee interface.File: Cashier.javapublic  class Cashier implements Employee{
	/*
	     In this class,there are many methods which are not applicable to cashier because
	     it is a leaf node.
	 */
	    private int id;
            private String name;
	    private double salary;
	    public Cashier(int id,String name,double salary)  {
	        this.id=id;
	        this.name = name;
	        this.salary = salary;
	    }
	    @Override
	    public void add(Employee employee) {
	        //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
	    }
	    @Override
	    public Employee getChild(int i) {
	        //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
	        return null;
	    }
	    @Override
		public int getId() {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			return id;
	    }
	    @Override
	    public String getName() {
	        return name;
	    }
	    @Override
	    public double getSalary() {
	        return salary;
	    }
	    @Override
	    public void print() {
	        System.out.println("==========================");
	        System.out.println("Id ="+getId());
	        System.out.println("Name ="+getName());
	        System.out.println("Salary ="+getSalary());
	        System.out.println("==========================");
	    }
	    @Override
	    public void remove(Employee employee) {
	        //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
	    }
}Step 4Create a Accountant class that will also be treated as a leaf and it will implement to the Employee interface.File: Accountant.javapublic class Accountant implements Employee{
/*
    In this class,there are many methods which are not applicable to cashier because
    it is a leaf node.
*/
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double salary;
   public Accountant(int id,String name,double salary)  {
   	   this.id=id;
       this.name = name;
       this.salary = salary;
   }
   @Override
   public void add(Employee employee) {
       //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
   }
   @Override
   public Employee getChild(int i) {
       //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
       return null;
   }
   @Override
	public int getId() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return id;
   }
   @Override
   public String getName() {
       return name;
   }
   @Override
   public double getSalary() {
       return salary;
   }
   @Override
   public void print() {
       System.out.println("=========================");
       System.out.println("Id ="+getId());
       System.out.println("Name ="+getName());
       System.out.println("Salary ="+getSalary());
       System.out.println("=========================");
   }
  @Override
   public void remove(Employee employee) {
       //this is leaf node so this method is not applicable to this class.
   }
}

Step 5Create a CompositePatternDemo class that will also be treated as a Client and ii will use the Employee interface.File: CompositePatternDemo.javapublic class CompositePatternDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		 Employee emp1=new Cashier(101,"Sohan Kumar", 20000.0);
		 Employee emp2=new Cashier(102,"Mohan Kumar", 25000.0);
		 Employee emp3=new Accountant(103,"Seema Mahiwal", 30000.0); 
		 Employee manager1=new BankManager(100,"Ashwani Rajput",100000.0);
		  
		  manager1.add(emp1);
		  manager1.add(emp2);
		  manager1.add(emp3);
		  manager1.print();
        }
