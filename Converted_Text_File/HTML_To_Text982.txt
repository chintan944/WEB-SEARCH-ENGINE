It is a vaccine that provides protection against tuberculosis; it helps build immunity against tuberculosis. The vaccine was developed by two French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin. It was first used in 1921 by Dr Weil-Hale for the treatment of a child who had tuberculosis. In the next three years (up to 1924), around 320 infants were vaccinated with BCG.The vaccine is given to children and persons at higher risk developing tuberculosis such as people living in the TB-affected parts of the world or children having one or more parents affected with TB or born in the TB-affected countries. It is also given to people suffering from bladder tumors or bladder cancer.How BCG Vaccine Works?BCG vaccine is a weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis which is a type of bacteria that cause TB. This vaccine when administered in the body stimulates the immune system in response to the bacteria without actually causing the disease. The antibodies remain in the body that protects against future infections with the same bacteria. Thus, BCG vaccine helps our body to produce antibodies against the bacteria of TB that provides immunity against tuberculosis.Who should not get BCG?This vaccine can cause complications in some people.
