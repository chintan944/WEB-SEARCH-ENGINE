It is used to get the input string through these production rules. During parsing, we have to take two decisions. These are as follows:We have to decide the non-terminal which is to be replaced.We have to decide the production rule by which the non-terminal will be replaced.We have two options to decide which non-terminal to be placed with production rule.1. Leftmost Derivation:In the leftmost derivation, the input is scanned and replaced with the production rule from left to right. So in leftmost derivation, we read the input string from left to right.Example:Production rules:E = E + E
E = E - E
E = a | bInputa - b + aThe leftmost derivation is:E = E + E
E = E - E + E
E = a - E + E
E = a - b + E
E = a - b + a2. Rightmost Derivation:In rightmost derivation, the input is scanned and replaced with the production rule from right to left. So in rightmost derivation, we read the input string from right to left.ExampleProduction rules:E = E + E
E = E - E
E = a | bInputa - b + aThe rightmost derivation is:E = E - E
E = E - E + E
E = E - E + a
E = E - b + a
E = a - b + aWhen we use the leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation, we may get the same string. This type of derivation does not affect on getting of a string.Examples of Derivation:Example 1:Derive the string "abb" for leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation using a CFG given by,S ?
