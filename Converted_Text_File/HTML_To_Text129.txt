They look similar so people often confuse one with the other. Despite some physical similarities, these two reptiles are different from each other in terms of their appearance and behaviour. Let us see how an alligator differs from a crocodile!Alligator:Alligators are large reptiles that belong to the order Crocodylia or Crocodilia. They are native to southern USA and China. The American alligators can grow upto 4.5 meters and weigh around 450 Kilograms. The Chinese alligators are small as they usually grow up to 1.5 meters and weigh around 23 kg.Alligators are social creatures, i.e. they often stay in groups called congregations. They can be seen basking in the sun or swimming together. Alligators are cold-blooded animals, i.e. they cannot generate their own body heat. So, when they are cold, they lie in the sun to warm themselves. When they are hot, they cool off by taking a dip in the water.They are carnivores, i.e. they may eat fish, birds, mollusks, small mammals and other reptiles. According to studies, the temperature of the alligator's nest decides the sex of their offspring. For example, females are produced when the temperature remains below 28 degree Celsius and males are produced when the temperature remains above 33 degree Celsius.Crocodile:Crocodiles are large reptiles that belong to the order Crocodilia. They are mostly found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia and Americas. There are many species of crocodiles, so they can be of different sizes. The dwarf crocodile is the smallest species of crocodile which grows upto 1.7 meters and weighs around 7 kilograms. Whereas, the largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile which grows upto 6.2 meters and weighs around 907 kilograms.Crocodiles are carnivores, i.e. they eat only meat such as fish, birds, frogs, small mammals, crustaceans etc. They are also cold-blooded animals so cannot generate body heat on their own. A female crocodile lays 10 to 60 eggs at a time. The hatchlings are 7 to 10 inches long and mature when their age is between 4 to 15 years. The average lifespan of a crocodile is 30 to 75 years.Based on the above information, some of the key differences between alligator and crocodile are as follows:AlligatorCrocodileAlligators are mostly found in the southeastern US and eastern China.Crocodiles are mostly found in Africa, Australia, and America.They are smaller than crocodiles.
