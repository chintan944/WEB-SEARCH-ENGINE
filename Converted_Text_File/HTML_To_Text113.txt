It is a packet sniffer, so it is basically designed to capture all the packets around us while we are in Monitor mode. We can run it against all of the networks around us and collect useful information like the mac address, channel name, encryption type, number of clients connected to the network and then start targeting to the target network. We can also run it against certain AP(access point) so that we only capture packets from a certain Wi-Fi network.Syntaxairodump-ng [MonitorModeInterface]First, let's look at how to run the program.
