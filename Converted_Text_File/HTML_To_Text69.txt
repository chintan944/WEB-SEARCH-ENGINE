It can enable more and more services as the need arises. It minimizes the impact on existing service.It is possible to change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading in the entire application.Microservices allows us to develop an application which is organic (an application which latterly upgrades by adding more functions or modules) in nature.It enables event streaming technology to enable easy integration in comparison to heavyweight interposes communication.Microservices follows the single responsibility principle.The demanding service can be deployed on multiple servers to enhance performance.Less dependency and easy to test.Dynamic scaling.Faster release cycle.Disadvantages of MicroservicesMicroservices has all the associated complexities of the distributed system.There is a higher chance of failure during communication between different services.Difficult to manage a large number of services.The developer needs to solve the problem, such as network latency and load balancing.Complex testing over a distributed environment.Next TopicChallenges of Microservices Architecture? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
