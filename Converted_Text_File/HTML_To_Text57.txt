The second section will contain the MCQ questions based on C/C++/JAVA output based questions, and coding question, which will be subjective. This round is organized on Hackerrank Platform, in which candidate can code in any of preferred language(C, C++ or Java). The first section of this round will be the most comfortable round of complete recruitment process but needs a good speed to clear it.Test Pattern for the first round:SectionsTime durationNumber of questionsTopicsAptitude15 min15 questionsQuantitate AptitudeArithmetic AlgebraTime and workProfit & LossGeometrySpeed & distancePercentageReasoning Section30 min30 questionsLogical ReasoningPuzzlesData interpretationBlood relation, etc.Technical(MCQ) +Coding test(subjective)75-120 min15-20 QuestionsC languageData StructureBit ManipulationA. Quantitative and Reasoning SectionThe quantitate aptitude section of the recruitment process is relatively easy, but candidates need to have basics clear and must have a good speed. There is no negative marking.The analytical section contains the tricky questions which can consume more time so be careful while attempting these section.Sample aptitude questions with the answer to prepare for the first round:Aptitude Interview Questions1) If a bulb in a room flashes on every 9 seconds, how many times will it flash in ¾ of an hour?301300250401Show AnswerAnswer: aExplanation:Bulb flash on every 9 seconds.¾ of an hour= ¾* 60 = 45 min45 min= 45*60 = 2700 secondsSo light will flash in ¾ of an hour= 2700/9= 300 timesBut count starts after the first flash hence the total number of time = 300+1= 3012) The present age of Arjun, Ram, and Vivek is in the proportion of 4:7:9. If 9 years ago, the sum of their age was 53, then what will be their present age?16,28,368,20,2820,35,45None of the aboveShow AnswerAnswer: aExplanation: The present age of Arjun, Ram, and Vivek is in the ratio of 4:7:9Let, the present age of Arjun= 4xPresent age of Ram= 7xPresent age of Vivek= 9xAs per question(4x-9)+ (7x-9) + (9x-9) = 5320x-27=53X=4So the present age of Arjun= 16, Ram= 28, and Vivek = 363) If the average age of employees in an office is 40 years and 120 new employees joined the company whose average age is 32 years. Hence the average age of all employees decreased by 4 years. So what is the total number of employees in the company now?1200120360240Show AnswerAnswer: dExplanation:Let's x be an initial total number of employeesInitial average age of employees = 40 years(Initial total age of employee)/x=40Initial total age of employees= 40xTotal age of 120 employees= 32*120As per question:Average age is decreased by 4, hence(40x+32*120)/(x+120) = (40-4)(40x+3840)=36*(x+120)4x=4320-3840X=120So total number of employees now in the company = 120+120= 2404) Find the largest 4 digit number, which will be exactly divisible by 88?9768998899448888Show AnswerAnswer: cExplanation:The largest 4 digit number= 99999999/88= remainder =55So the new number will be = 9999-55= 9944It will be completely divisible by 88; hence the largest number will be 99445) Compute the sum of the first five prime numbers?11182628Show AnswerAnswer: dExplanation:Required sum of five prime number = (2+ 3+5+7+11) = 286) 'A' alone can complete 1/4th of the work in 2 days. 'B' alone can complete 2/3th of the work in 4 days. If all the three workers work together, they can complete the work in 3 days so what part of the work will be completed by 'C' alone in 2 days?1/121/81/161/20Show AnswerAnswer: aExplanation:Let's one day work by C = x1-day work by A= 1/81-day work by B= 1/6As per question:1/8+1/6+x= 1/3By solving the equation:x=1/24If x's1 day work = 1/24So two day's work by c = 1/127) One day Ravi started moving 30 minutes late from home and reached his office late by 50 minutes while driving 25% slower than his usual speed. How much time does Ravi usually take to reach his office from home?20 min80 min60 min40 minShow AnswerAnswer: cExplanation:Let suppose t is usual time to reach to office from home, Usual time and speed time= t, speed = sLate time and speed 25% slower speed = 3/4s, time= t+20D = s*tD= (3s/4)*(t+20)S*t= (3s/4)*(t+20)4t= 3t+60t= 60 min.8) A shopkeeper sells one table for Rs. 840 at a gain of 20% and another table for Rs. 960 at a loss of 4%. What will be his total gain or loss?100/17% gain100/17% loss20/3% gainNone of them.Show AnswerAnswer: aExplanation:Cost price for 1 table = (100*840) / (100+20) = 700Cost price for 2 table = (100*960) / (100-4) = 1000Total cost price of tables = 1000+700=1700Total selling price = 840+960 = 1800Gain = selling price- cost priceGain = 1800-1700= 100Gain%= (100*100) / 1700Gain% = 100/179) If in a conical tent, there is a space for accommodation of 10 persons. Each person must have 6 sq. Meter space to stand and 30 cubic meters of air to breathe. What will be the height of the cone?15m37.5m75m150mShow AnswerAnswer: 30mExplanation:If, Space occupied by 1 person= 6 sq. mSpace occupied by 10 person = 60sq. mHence base area of conical tent= pi*r*r = 60As each person needs air to breath = 30 cubic meter10 person needs air to breadth= 300 cubic meterSo, the volume of the conical tent, (1/3)*pi*r*r*h= 60020*h= 600h= 30m10) A can do a piece of work in 10 days, B can do the same work in 12 days and Ravi in 15 days. They all start the work together, but A leaves after 2 days and B leaves 3 days before the completion of work. Find the days in which work will be completed.6 days5 days9 days7 daysShow AnswerAnswer: dExplanation:The work completed by,A in 10 days, B in 12 days, C in 15 days,Total work done to be completed= L.C.M of (10, 12, 15) = 60unitSo A can do 6 unit of work in 1 day, B can do 5 unit, C can do 4 unitAs per the question, Let in x days' remaining work will be completed, then(6+5+4)*2+ (5+4)*(x-3) + (4*3) = 60 unitAfter solving,30+ 9(x-3) +12=60X=5 daysSo total required days = 5+2= 7 days.Reasoning Questions:1) If MADRAS can be coded as NBESBT, then how can we code BOMBAY?CQOCBZCPOCBZCPNCBZCPNCPXShow AnswerAnswer: CExplanation:M A D R A S <=========> N B E S B TEvery letter is equivalent to its next letter, so M with N, A with B, D with E, and so on.HenceB O M B A Y can be written as C P N C B Z2) Which will be the next term in the series: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13,_______16151817Show AnswerAnswer: cExplanation:As in the given series, 3, (3+1=4), (4+2=6), (6+3=9), (9+4=13), so__ (13+5=18) Hence next term will be 183) If w, x, y z are integers.

4th node from end is: 30Technical Round interview questions:This is the third main round of the Adobe interview process. It contains various rounds. In this round, candidates are checked on their technical skills. If candidate clears one round, then he/she can proceed for the next round.Technical First round1) Differentiate between typedef and #define?The primary difference between typedef and #define is given below:typedef is used to define the types or to give a new name to types whereas #define is pre-processor directive, which is used to define the macro.typedef gives the actual definition to the new datatype, whereas #define is used just to copy-paste the value definition where it is used.typedef is known to the compiler, but #define is just known to pre-processor.Example:#include <stdio.h> 
typedef int CHAR; 
#define AP "Andhra Pradesh"

int main() 
{ 
	CHAR a, b; 
	a = 10; 
	printf("%d\n""%s"  , a, AP); 
	return 0; 
}Output:10
Andhra Pradesh2) Why we use sprint() function?sprint() is a C library function which is termed as "string print." sprintf function is used to hold the formatted data output as String.Syntax:int  sprintf (char *string,  const char *form, .... )Example:#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
	char string[50]; 
	int a = 10, b = 5, c; 
	c = a * b; 
	sprintf(string, "multiplication of %d and %d is %d", a, b, c); 
           	printf("%s",  string); 
return 0; 
}Output:multiplication of 10 and 5 is 23) How to differentiate between char a[]= ?String and char*a =?String.The statements:Char a[ ]= "computer";char *a= "computer";The difference between the above two statements is that the first statement will create an array of 9 elements will automatically add the null pointer and the size of array 'a' will be 9.But the second statement will create a pointer variable. We cannot perform any array operation on this pointer variable as it will be stored in read-only mode.Example:#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
	char a[] = "Computer"; 
	printf("%lu", sizeof(a)); 
	a[1] = 'n'; 
	printf("\n%s", a); 
	return 0; 
}    Output:9
CnmputerExample 2#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
	char *a = "Computer"; 
	printf("%lu", sizeof(a)); 

	return 0; 
}4) Explain Data breakpoints? Where can we use this?Data Breakpoint is a strong feature available for C++, which allow us to stop the execution when the value stored at a particular memory location changes. Data breakpoints can be used to solve the memory corruption issue.5) Differentiate between new and malloc()?The new and malloc() both are used for dynamic memory allocation. But there are various differences between new and malloc, which are given below,new is an operator in C language, whereas malloc() is a function for memory allocation.new operator calls the constructor, whereas malloc() does not call the constructor.The memory allocated from the "free store" by new operator, whereas memory allocated from the heap by malloc() function.On failure of execution, new operator throws an exception, whereas malloc() returns Null.new operator does not require the sizeof() operator, malloc() function requires the sizeof() operator to know the memory size.6) Differentiate between process and thread?Following are the basic differences between the process and the thread:The Process is an execution of a program, whereas thread is a lightweight process.A Process does not share the resources like memory, whereas thread can share the resources.The Process takes more time for context switching, whereas thread requires less time for context switching.The Process is less efficient as compared to a thread in terms of communication.7) What is C++ Shorthand property? What is its role?C++ provides shorthand property, which enables a programmer to use the assignment operator in a shorter way.Example:x=x+5; can be written as x+=5 using shorthandx=x-10; can be written as x-=10;8) What do you understand by function prototype declaration and definition?Function prototype declaration: function prototype declaration statement gives the following information about the function:It tells the symbolic name of the functions.Information about the return type of function.Information about the argument passed as input with their datatypes.Example:int add(int a, int b, int c)Where add is the name of a function, and a, b and c are the passed arguments.Function definition: The function definition is the actual source code of the function. Function definition gives information that what that function actually does.Example:int add(int a, int b, int c){c= a + b; return c; }9) What do you understand by Conditional Operators?Conditional operators are ternary operators with three operands, which are used as shorthand in place of the if-else statement.Conditional operators return the first expression if the condition is true and return second expression if the condition is false.Syntax:(Check expression)? Expression1: Expression2;Example:var = (x < 10) ? 20 : 40;10) What is volatile Keyword in C?The volatile keyword is a qualifier which is used with the variables at the time of declaration.It gives the information to the compiler that variable's value can be changed at any instance of time even it does not appear to be modified.Volatile keyword is used to declare a variable as a volatile variable. It can be used before the datatype or after the data type.Syntax:volatile int x;   or int volatile x; 11) What do you understand by OS? Explain in Easiest way.An operating system is a program which is an interface between the user and hardwareIt manages all other programs in the computer after loaded, by a boot program.OS works as a backbone for the computer or mobile devices.Examples of an operating system are UNIX, LINUX, MS- Windows, MAC-OS, etc.12) Why we use pointers in C and C++?Pointers are the variables which stores address of another variable in C and C++.Following are the main reasons that why we use pointers in C and C++:Pointers can be used for dynamic memory allocation.Pointers help to perform array arithmetic and accessing an array element.Pointers are helpful in creating API.Pointers are used in the implementation of the data structure.Pointers are beneficial to pass by reference.13) Differentiate between call by pointer and call by reference?In C++ language, we can pass an argument to a function by reference or by pointer, both are the correct approaches and precisely same, but the basic differences between both are:We can assign pointer as a null pointer directly, but it cannot be done with reference.We can reassign a pointer, but reference cannot be reassigned.14) What do you understand by calloc() and malloc()?In C, calloc() and malloc() are the library functions, and both are used for dynamic memory allocation. Which means it allocates the memory at run-time as per requirement from the heap section.malloc(): malloc() function is a library function which allocates a single block of requested memory and return a pointer void to it, which can be cast to any return type. It returns the null value if sufficient memory is not available.Syntax:ptr=(cast-type*)malloc(byte-size)calloc(): calloc() function is also a library function which allocates the multiple blocks of memory of requested size. It initially initializes the memory to zero and returns NULL if memory is not sufficient.Syntax:ptr=(cast-type*)calloc(number, byte-size)15) Explain the term, "virtual machine"?The Virtual machine is a software program which behaves like a separate computer. It works same as the main computer and also capable of running applications and other programs. A virtual machine, called as a guest is created within the main machine called as host. There are two types of virtual machines depending upon their uses.System virtual machineProcess virtual machine16) What do you understand by Synchronization?Synchronization is a process of performing two things simultaneously at the same time.Synchronization is of two types:Process or thread synchronizationData synchronizationProcess synchronization: Process/thread synchronization is a mechanism which controls the access of shared resources between two concurrent threads. It ensures that two concurrent thread do not share the same resource at the same time. Synchronization deals with problems such as deadlock, starvation, busy waiting, etc.Data Synchronization: Data synchronization is a technique which ensure the integrity of data between two devices. With the help of data synchronization, it keeps multiple copies of single data in different location. It includes file synchronization, journaling, Raid, etc.17) Explain the term Mutex? What is Reader-writer problem?Mutex:In multithreading, Mutex(mutual exclusion object) is a program object which provides locking mechanism to the threads.Mutex ensures the proper thread synchronization between two or more threads. Only one thread can execute a program or resources at a time.Reader-writer problem:In OS, a situation is called as Reader-writer problem for a particular shared data area which involves:Any number of reader can read from that shared area, but only one writer can write at one time.No other process can access that area when one writer is writing in that particular area.If in that shared area there are non-zero readers then writer cannot write there.This problem mostly occurs in Concurrency or multithreading.18) Why we use void keyword?We can use void keyword for two purposes:Function parameter: When we use void as function parameter, it means function does not accept any value.Example:int showMessage(void){   
}Function Return type: When we use void as function return type, it means it will not return anything.Example:void showMessage() {
} void keyword can also be used with the pointers which makes it more powerful as, when void is used with pointer it termed as generic type, which can hold address of any type.19) Explain the exit controlled loop?An Exit controlled loop is a type of loop which first execute the instruction and then checks the condition. When we use exit controlled loop, then at least one time execution occurs even if the condition is false. The do-while loop is an example of exit controlled loop.#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
int x = 10; 
do{
    printf("\n the value of x is %d", x);
    x - -;
}
while(x>=5);
   return 0; 
}

Output: 
the value of x is 10
 the value of x is 9
 the value of x is 8
 the value of x is 7
 the value of x is 6
 the value of x is 520) What is a DNS server?DNS server is a main part of DNS (Domain Name System) infrastructure. It is a computer server which stores and manages the database of IP addresses and their respective Hosts name.DNS server is also called as name server, which is used to map the domain name to the corresponding IP address.A single domain name can have multiple IP's that means IP addresses can vary with time.Technical Second Round1) What are the different layers in TCP/IP models? Explain the protocols at each layer?TCP/IP model is termed as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP model is a practical and concise version of the OSI model. Current network architecture depends on the TCP/IP model. It consists of mainly four layers:Application LayerTransport Layer/Host-to-host layerNetwork LayerLink Layer/Network Access Layer1. Link Layer:is responsible for the physical flow of data through the network. It consists of hardware devices such as optical fibre, coaxial cable, or twisted pair, etc. In this layer, data travels in the form of bits and frames.The protocol used at this level is Ethernet, token ring, etc.2. Internet Layer:Internet layer is the Upper layer of the Link layer. This layer converts the data into data-packets, called as IP datagrams and send these datagrams across the host through the network. These datagrams consist of host and destination address, by which they are forwarded through the network.The primary protocols used at this level are:IP (internet protocol): This protocol is responsible for forwarding the packets from source host to destination using an address which is consisted by packet header. IP has two main versions IPv4 and IPv6.ICMP (Internet control message protocol): This protocol is mainly responsible for informing the problem in the network.ARP (Address resolution protocol): ARP protocol is an essential protocol of the TCP/IP model, and it is responsible to resolve an IPv4 address to physical address.3. Transport Layer: This is the third layer of the TCP/IP model, which is responsible for the communication between the source host and destination host and error-free data transmission.This layer consists of mainly two protocols:TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a reliable protocol for error-free communication between the source and destination host. It's a connection-oriented protocol.UDP (User Datagram Protocol): This protocol is not reliable as compare to TCP protocol, we can use this protocol which does not require reliable communication. It is a connectionless protocol.4. Application layer: This is the top layer of the TCP/IP model. It describes the application protocol and provides node-to-node communication.This layer contains various higher level protocols which are:HTTP and HTTPs(Hypertext transfer protocol)FTP(File transfer protocol)SSH( Secure Shell)TFTP(Trivial file transfer protocol)SMTP(Simple mail transfer protocol)DHCP(Dynamic host configuration protocol)2) Explain the working of the stack while calling a function? When stack overflow occurred?The Stack is a particular area of RAM, just like as Heap. But stack is used to store local variables, parameters and return values used inside a function and stack stores and deallocates memory automatically.When we call a function, stack performs following steps:Push space for the return variables.Push parameters in the stack.Push the local variable of the function.When we call a function, stack adds a stack frame which consists space for actual parameters, local variables, return address, etc. This stack frame lives in active frame till the time function is being called, and once execution finishes then stack remove that stack frame from the stack.Stack Overflow: As we know that stack deallocated the memory and free up space after execution but still there is a condition when complete stack space used, and there is no more space to save the variables, so this is called stack overflow. It occurs because the space size of the stack is also limited in size, and at the time of execution if we allocate more memory than available memory than overflow occurred and the program got crashed. Some example for stack overflow are:Use of Infinite recursionUse of very large stack variableUse of very deep recursion3) Explain the meaning for the declaration: int*const p & const int* const p?int * const p: By declaring a pointer in such a way that means we are declaring point variable p as constant, which cannot be changed. We cannot change the address its holding, or it cannot point to other variables. If we try to change the address of p, then it will give a compile time error.const int * const p: By declaring a pointer in such a way means, we cannot change the address of the pointer as we as we cannot change the address at that address. If we try to do it, then it will generate a compile time error.4) What are default functions in C++C++ provides the six default member functions which are given below:Default constructorDestructorsCopy constructorsCopy assignment operatorsMove constructorsMove assignment operators5) Which data structure is used for the dictionary?To implement a dictionary, which type of data structure should be used depends on what we required, there are some following data structure which can be used for implementation of the dictionary.Hash-table: If we want a simple dictionary with no option for the prefix, or nearest neighbour search then we can use Hashing or Hashtable for the dictionary.Trie: It can be a good option if we want to add prefix and fast lookup. But, it takes more space than other data structures.Ternary Search Tree: If we want all the qualities like trie but do not want to give the more space then we can use ternary search tree.BK-tree: BK-tree is one of the best data structure if we want specifications like spell checker, find the similar word, etc.6) How can you find a unique word from a String which also has duplicate words?We can find the unique word from a string by using HashMap, Set and Regex.Candidate can also be asked for questions like:Implement Snake and Ladder game and find the minimum number of moves required to reach from 1 to 100 in a given game, using Dynamic Programming.Model a data structure for a DFA that takes an event as parameter and performs a desired action.Solve the three mislabelled jars problem.How to compare two binary trees?How to prove that in a tree the number of internal nodes is one less than leaves?Technical third round or director RoundThis round is a challenging round as in this round the manager ask the questions based on your projects, so candidate must have in-depth knowledge about their project which they have done and some problematic puzzles which candidates needs to solve.1) Write an algorithm for the tower of Hanoi?Tower of Hanoi is a very popular mathematics puzzle. In this puzzle, we are given three disk and three rods. Disks are arranged in the first rod like a stack, in ascending order. We need to transfer the disk from the first rod to third in the same order.There are some rules as well:We can move one disk at one timeWe can only move the uppermost diskDisk always should be in ascending order, i.e., a bigger disk cannot put on a smaller one.Algorithm:Let's suppose there are thee towers Beg, Aux, and Dest, and there are two disks where n disk is larger disk and n-1 is smaller one.StartStep 1: shift n-1 disk from tower Beg to AuxStep 2: shift n disk from Beg to EndStep 3: shift disk n-1 form tower Aux to C.Tower(n, Beg, Aux, Dest)
Begin
If n=1 then,
Print: Beg-> Dest;
else
 Call Tower(n-1, Beg, Dest, Aux);
Call Tower(n, Beg, Aux, End);
Call Tower(n-1, Aux, Beg, End);
endif
End2) Write a code to find the loop in a Linked list? How will you remove this loop?#include<stdio.h> 
#include<stdlib.h> 
struct Node 
{ 
	int data; 
	struct Node* next; 
}; 

/* Function for removing the loop. */
void remLoop(struct Node *, struct Node *); 

/*Function to remove and detect the loop*/
int detAndRemLoop(struct Node *list) 
{ 
	struct Node *p1 = list, *p2 = list; 

	while (p1 && p2 && p2->next) 
	{ 
		p1 = p1->next; 
		p2 = p2->next->next; 

		/*if p1 and p2 will meet at some point which means there is a loop*/
		if (p1 == p2) 
		{ 
			remLoop(p1, list); 
	                           printf("Loop is occurred\n"); 
			/* Return 1 if loop is found */
			return 1; 
		
		} 
	} 

	/* Return 0 if there is no loop*/
	return 0; 
} 

/* Function to remove loop. */
void remLoop(struct Node *loop_node, struct Node *head) 
{ 
	struct Node *ptr1 = loop_node; 
	struct Node *ptr2 = loop_node; 

	// Count the number of nodes in loop 
	unsigned int k = 1, i; 
	while (ptr1->next != ptr2) 
	{ 
		ptr1 = ptr1->next; 
		k++; 
	} 

	// Fix one pointer to head 
	ptr1 = head; 
	ptr2 = head; 
	for (i = 0; i < k; i++) 
	ptr2 = ptr2->next; 
	while (ptr2 != ptr1) 
	{ 
		ptr1 = ptr1->next; 
		ptr2 = ptr2->next; 
	} 
	ptr2 = ptr2->next; 
	while (ptr2->next != ptr1) 
	ptr2 = ptr2->next; 

	/* Set the next node to Null to fix the loop */
	ptr2->next = NULL; 
} 

/* Function to print linked list */
void printList(struct Node *node) 
{ 
	while (node != NULL) 
	{ 
		printf("%d ", node->data); 
		node = node->next; 
	} 
} 

struct Node *newNode(int key)

40 15 12 10 43) How will you design a data structure for excel spreadsheets?We can design an excel spreadsheets by using:Two-dimensional array ( but it will take lots of space)Sparse matrixMap, etc.4) Explain memory protection in OS.Memory protection is a mechanism which controls the unauthorized access of memory in the computer. Memory protection prevents the unallocated memory access by a process. Memory address is first checked before used by a process, to see whether it is allocated address or not.There are two registers LBR and UBR are used to implement memory protection.5) What is Virtual Memory in OS?Virtual Memory is memory management technique of Operating System. Virtual memory is an extra space provided to a program when a main memory does not have the sufficient space to execute a code. It temporarily transfers data from RAM to disk storage, which uses inactive memory of hard disk, which is termed as Virtual Memory.6) Write an algorithm to insert an element into a sorted linked list?Suppose the linked list is sorted in ascending order then following is the algorithm for the same. Let the input node is 13 and let assign as nSuppose Input linked list is:3 8 11 15 20 1) If given linked list is empty then assign the node as head and return it.2) If value of the node n is less than value of head node, then insert the node at start and assign it as head.3) In a loop, search the appropriate node after which the input node is to be inserted. To search the appropriate node start from head, keep moving until you reach a node x(Let?s suppose 15)whose value is greater than the input node. The node before the x will be the appropriate node(11).4) Insert the node(13) after the appropriate node(11) found in step 3.After insertion:3 8 11 13 15 20 7) Find pair of elements whose sum equal to a given number?#include <stdio.h>

void Pair(int arr[], int n, int sum)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <=n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <=n; j++)
        {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == sum){
            
                printf("Pair element found at position %d and %d\n ", i, j);}
            
        }
    }
}
 

int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 5,8,9,1,6,2,7,3};
    int sum = 11;
 
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
 
    Pair(arr, n, sum);
 
    return 0;
}Output:Pair element found at position 0 and 4
 Pair element found at position 1 and 7
 Pair element found at position 2 and 5Candidates can also be asked for following questions:If there is an array of number which contains numbers from 1 to n. If we replace 1 number with another. Find both number in O (N).If in a marriage function there are n people then arrange those people in two groups, such that each person know each other?Implement Snake and Ladder game and find the minimum number of moves required to reach from 1 to 100 in a given game, using Dynamic Programming.There are n houses in a city. All in a single row. We can colour a house with any one of three colours (R,G,B). Cost of colouring each house is given for each colour. No two neighbour house can have same colour.
