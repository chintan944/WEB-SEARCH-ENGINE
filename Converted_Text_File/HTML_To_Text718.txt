The patterns are hatched, gradient, and solid fill.The gradient patterns are defined as a smooth transition between two colors.There are several hatch patterns available in AutoCAD. We can choose the desired pattern from the list of the patterns according to the requirements.The number of hatch lines represented in any pattern can be adjusted with the help of the Hatch Pattern Scale.The Hatch Pattern Scale signifies the spacing between the lines in a particular pattern.Let's understand with few examples.Example 1:Consider the below image:The steps to fill hatch pattern are listed below:Select the Hatch icon from the ribbon panel, as shown in the below image:OrType H on the command line or command prompt and press Enter.Pick internal points of any object.OrSelect objects.Here, we have picked an internal point inside a circle. We can pick any point inside a circle.A hatch pattern will be created inside the circle, as shown below:To modify the lines, we have increased the Hatch Pattern Scale.The figure will now appear as:We can also select the desired patterns from the list of patterns, as shown below:The greater the hatch pattern Scale, the higher will be the distance between the lines in the hatch pattern.When we click on the arrow near the Hatch Icon, a drop-down list appears, as shown in the below image:BoundaryThe Boundary command creates a separate region or polyline from the enclosed area.GradientLet's understand the gradient with an example:Example 1:Consider the below image:The steps are listed below:Select the Gradient Icon from the drop-down list of the hatch.Pick internal points of any object or select objects. Here, we have picked an internal point outside the circle.A gradient will be created inside the rectangle, as shown below:Let's consider another gradient pattern. It will look like the below image:We can also select the desired patterns from the list of patterns, as shown below:Next TopicAutoCAD LineTypes? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
