The category of language in Chomsky's Hierarchy is as given below:Type 0 known as Unrestricted Grammar.Type 1 known as Context Sensitive Grammar.Type 2 known as Context Free Grammar.Type 3 Regular Grammar.This is a hierarchy. Therefore every language of type 3 is also of type 2, 1 and 0. Similarly, every language of type 2 is also of type 1 and type 0, etc.Type 0 Grammar:Type 0 grammar is known as Unrestricted grammar. There is no restriction on the grammar rules of these types of languages. These languages can be efficiently modeled by Turing machines.For example:bAa ? aa
S ? sType 1 Grammar:Type 1 grammar is known as Context Sensitive Grammar. The context sensitive grammar is used to represent context sensitive language. The context sensitive grammar follows the following rules:The context sensitive grammar may have more than one symbol on the left hand side of their production rules.The number of symbols on the left-hand side must not exceed the number of symbols on the right-hand side.The rule of the form A ? ? is not allowed unless A is a start symbol. It does not occur on the right-hand side of any rule.The Type 1 grammar should be Type 0. In type 1, Production is in the form of V ? TWhere the count of symbol in V is less than or equal to T.For example:S ? AT
T ? xy
A ? aType 2 Grammar:Type 2 Grammar is known as Context Free Grammar. Context free languages are the languages which can be represented by the context free grammar (CFG). Type 2 should be type 1. The production rule is of the formA ? ?Where A is any single non-terminal and is any combination of terminals and non-terminals.For example:A ? aBb
A ? b
B ? aType 3 Grammar:Type 3 Grammar is known as Regular Grammar. Regular languages are those languages which can be described using regular expressions. These languages can be modeled by NFA or DFA.Type 3 is most restricted form of grammar. The Type 3 grammar should be Type 2 and Type 1. Type 3 should be in the form ofV ? T*V / T*For example:A ? xyNext Topic#? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
