So, if we talk about alternative fuels like coal, wood, oil, etc., the only difference between them as recognized by modern economics is their relative cost per equivalent unit. Eventually, the cheapest is the one to be preferred, although it would be irrational and uneconomical. As per Buddhism, the major difference between non-renewable fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas on the one hand and renewable fuels like wood and water power, on the other hand, cannot be overlooked. Non-renewable fuels must be used only if they are necessary and it should not be wasted, to use these resources carelessly is an act of violence.Question 1: What is contrary to the Buddhist economic philosophy? prefer to use non-renewable resources excessively over renewable resourcesusing renewable resources excessively over non-renewable resourcesspending more on expensive products than cheaper onesspending more on cheaper products than expensive onesShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: AQuestion 2: In this passage, the author has given emphasis on theimportance of renewable energythe difference between renewable and non-renewable materialsdifference between two economic philosophiesimportance of renewable energyShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: CQuestion 3: The philosophy of which religion is discussed in this passage?

The scenario was different around fifty-five years ago. Polio mainly affects the brain and spinal cord and causes stiffening and weakening of muscles, crippling and paralysis. This is the reason why Rex is in a wheelchair today. When he was born, no one would have predicted that he would suffer from polio. He was the sixth child in a family of three pairs of brothers and sisters, with a huge 20 year age gap between the first and last.

These insects generally lack the means to actively defend themselves, i.e., they don't have jaws, claws, sharp teeth, etc. However, they have evolved other equally effective deterrents. For example, there is a species of caterpillar that lives at an altitude of over 2500 meters in the Himalayas. It uses color to inform the predators that they are not edible. If an inexperienced predator eats the caterpillar, it would probably vomit it soon. So, the predator refrains from attacking this species in the future. Although the caterpillar dies, it benefits the species, i.e., an example of a martyr among caterpillars.Question 1: Predators like birds and reptiles prefer to eatFresh, soft leavessoft-bodied insectssoft-bodied animalsflowers and fruitsShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: BQuestion 2: Experienced predators do not eat the Himalayan caterpillars as theyare inediblehave clawshave stingsare poisonousShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: AQuestion 3: The Himalayan caterpillar uses color to attract the predatorsattack the predatorsreveal themselvesto inform that they are indelibleShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DQuestion 4: The caterpillars easily fall prey to predators like birds and reptiles because they are lazyare small in sizecannot flylack claws or jawsShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DQuestion 5: As per the passage, the caterpillar who dies is a martyr because it fights with predatorsits death benefits other caterpillarsit can change its colorNone of the aboveShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: B15)The growth and success of the electronics industry in Japan is its ability to organize production and marketing rather than research and analysis. The British are generally known for their inventions, but never seem able to exploit what they invent, e.g., there are plenty of examples like high-speed train, Sinclair scooter, Norton Motorcycle that shows this sad scenario. The Japanese were able to use their skills and strengths in the fields of marketing and development many years ago. Either their success was not understood in the West or was dismissed as they produced at low prices. Their products were sold as they were cheap copies of other people's ideas and developed and marketed by a dedicated workforce.Question 1: As per the passage, the success of a country's industry depends upon research and analysisinternational cooperationcheap labor and low pricededicated workforceShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DQuestion 2: The sad scenario mentioned in this passage refers to the inability of the Japanese to invent new things like the Britishthe inability of the British to learn from the Japanesethe low popularity of British productsthe inability of the British to market their inventionsShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DQuestion 3: High-speed train, Sinclair scooter, Norton Motorcycle are discussed in the context of Success of JapaneseFailure of JapaneseFailure of British inventionsSuccess of British inventionsShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: CQuestion 4: According to the passage, prosperity in industry depends upon availability of raw materialfinancial backgroundinvention abilityproduction and marketing abilityShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: DQuestion 5: The passage has given emphasis on the role of marketing in industrial successthe role of research and analysis in industrythe business relations between Japan and BritainNone of the aboveShow Answer WorkspaceAnswer: AComprehensionComprehension 2Comprehension 4Next TopicComprehension 4? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
