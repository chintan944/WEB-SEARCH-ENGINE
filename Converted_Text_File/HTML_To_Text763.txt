If the grammar is not ambiguous, then it is called unambiguous.If the grammar has ambiguity, then it is not good for compiler construction. No method can automatically detect and remove the ambiguity, but we can remove ambiguity by re-writing the whole grammar without ambiguity.Example 1:Let us consider a grammar G with the production ruleE ? I
E ? E + E
E ? E * E
E ? (E)
I ? ? | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 9Solution:For the string "3 * 2 + 5", the above grammar can generate two parse trees by leftmost derivation:Since there are two parse trees for a single string "3 * 2 + 5", the grammar G is ambiguous.Example 2:Check whether the given grammar G is ambiguous or not.E ? E + E
E ? E - E
E ? idSolution:From the above grammar String "id + id - id" can be derived in 2 ways:First Leftmost derivationE ? E + E
   ? id + E
   ? id + E - E
   ? id + id - E
   ? id + id- idSecond Leftmost derivationE ? E - E
   ? E + E - E
   ? id + E - E
   ? id + id - E
   ? id + id - idSince there are two leftmost derivation for a single string "id + id - id", the grammar G is ambiguous.Example 3:Check whether the given grammar G is ambiguous or not.S ? aSb | SS
S ? ?Solution:For the string "aabb" the above grammar can generate two parse treesSince there are two parse trees for a single string "aabb", the grammar G is ambiguous.Example 4:Check whether the given grammar G is ambiguous or not.A ? AA
A ? (A)
A ? aSolution:For the string "a(a)aa" the above grammar can generate two parse trees:Since there are two parse trees for a single string "a(a)aa", the grammar G is ambiguous.Next TopicUnambiguous Grammar? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
