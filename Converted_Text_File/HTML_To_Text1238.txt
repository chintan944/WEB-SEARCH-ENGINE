It is an energy saving lamp that consumes less power than the old incandescent lamps. It consists of a glass tube and two electrodes. The glass tube contains mixture of argon gas and mercury vapor and its inner surface has phosphor coating.How a CFL worksCFL has different mechanism to produce light than the incandescent lamps. In an incandescent lamp, electric current passes through a wire filament. It heats the filament and the filament glows to produce light. In CFL, the current passes through the tube containing the mixture of argon gas and mercury vapor. The current activates the mercury vapor which produces ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light then excites the phosphor coating on the inside of the tube which produces visible light.Types of CFLCFL can be of two types:IntegratedNon-integratedIntegrated: In an integrated CFL, the tube, the electronic ballast and the bayonet fitting are combined in one single unit.Non-integrated: In a non-integrated CFL, the electronic ballast is permanently installed in the luminaire. It is not combined with the bulb so only the bulb is needed to be changed at its end of life.Benefits of CFLEfficient: It uses 60-80% less energy than incandescent lamps.Durable and Cost-effective: It lasts more than ordinary bulbs and consumes less electricity, so it is less expensive in the long run.Eco-friendly: It helps reduce CO2 emission as CFL causes less CO2 emission as compared to an incandescent lamp.Versatile: CFLs are highly compatible and versatile. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes and powers to suit different home decors and purposes. You can also easily install them in a variety of light fixtures like table lamps, ceiling lamps, dimmer lamps etc.Produces less heat: It produces less heat as most of the energy is converted into visible light so very less converts into heat.Next TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
