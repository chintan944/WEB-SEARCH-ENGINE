In addition it uses an EEPROM memory for data storage.In System Programmable Flash Program Memory:ATmega32 microcontroller contains 32Kb of on-chip in system programmable flash memory for program storage. Flash memory is organized as 16K X 16K structure and its memory is divided into two sections application program section and boot program section.Consider the ISP programmer circuit diagram is:SRAM Data Memory:The Register file, the internal data SRAM and I/O memory are addressed by the lower 2144 data memory locations. The first 96 locations address the I/O memory and Register file, and the internal data Static RAM is addressed by the next 2048 locations.Consider the five different addressing modes for the data memory is:-Direct addressing modesIndirect addressing modesIndirect with displacement addressing modesIndirect with pre-decrement addressing modesIndirect with post-decrement addressing modesSRAM data memory have 32 general purpose registers, 2048 bytes of internal data SRAM, and 64 I/O registers are accessible by using the above addressing modes.Consider the SRAM data memory structure shown in block diagram of ATmega32 is:EEPROM Data Memory:ATmega32 contains 1024 bytes of data EEPROM memory. It can be used as a separate data space in which single bytes can be read and written.Next TopicATmega8 MicroController? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
