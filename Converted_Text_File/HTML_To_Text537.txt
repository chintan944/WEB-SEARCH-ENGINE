A program in android is first compiled, and then all of its parts are packaged into one single file to make it an APK file. APK files can be saved in compressed zip format, with any decompression or unzip tool it can be opened. You can either change the extension to .zip or open the file directly using unzip tools. They are a type of archive file. When you are downloading and installing an android application then actually you are installing an APK file. You can install an APK file directly from a desktop, or from within a file manager app without downloading.
