This method is used to obtain FA from the given regular expression. This method is given below:Step 1: Design a transition diagram for given regular expression, using NFA with ? moves.Step 2: Convert this NFA with ? to NFA without ?.Step 3: Convert the obtained NFA to equivalent DFA.Example 1:Design a FA from given regular expression 10 + (0 + 11)0* 1.Solution: First we will construct the transition diagram for a given regular expression.Step 1:Step 2:Step 3:Step 4:Step 5:Now we have got NFA without ?. Now we will convert it into required DFA for that, we will first write a transition table for this NFA.State01?q0q3{q1, q2}q1qf?q2?q3q3q3qf*qf??The equivalent DFA will be:State01?[q0][q3][q1, q2][q1][qf]?[q2]?[q3][q3][q3][qf][q1, q2][qf][qf]*[qf]??Example 2:Design a NFA from given regular expression 1 (1* 01* 01*)*.Solution: The NFA for the given regular expression is as follows:Step 1:Step 2:Step 3:Example 3:Construct the FA for regular expression 0*1 + 10.Solution:We will first construct FA for R = 0*1 + 10 as follows:Step 1:Step 2:Step 3:Step 4:Next TopicArden's Theorem? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
