C# language is a much-protected language as compiler gives errors and warnings without allowing you to create serious damage.CompilationC++ code is compiled to machine code C# code compiles to CLR(Common Language Runtime) which is interpreted by the JIT(Just In Time) compiler.Multiple InheritanceC++ language supports multiple inheritances, while C# language does not support the multiple inheritances.Level of DifficultyC++ language contains more complex features than C# language while C# language is a simple hierarchy which is quite easy to understand.Default access specifierIn C++, the default access specifier is public while in C#, the default access specifier is private.Object OrientedC++ language is not a complete object-oriented language while C# language is a pure object-oriented programming language.Bound checkingC++ language does not support the bound checking for arrays while C# language supports the bound checking for arrays.For each loopC++ language does not support the for each loop while C# language supports the for each loop.Use of pointersIn C++, we can use the pointers anywhere in the program while in C# language, pointers are used in the unsafe area.Switch statementIn C++, string variable cannot be passed in the switch statement, but in C# language, string variable can be passed in the switch statement.Standalone applicationsC++ language can be used to develop standalone applications, but C# language cannot be used to develop standalone applications.Next TopicC++ Tutorial? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
