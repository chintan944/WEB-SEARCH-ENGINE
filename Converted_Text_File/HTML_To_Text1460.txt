Raster or Bitmap images are resolution-dependent because of this, it's not possible to increase or reduce their size without sacrificing on image quality.While the vector-based display is not dependent on resolution, the range of vector image can be increased or reduced without affecting image quality.2. Unlike a raster image, a vector picture can't be used for realistic pictures. This is because vector images are made up of solid-color areas and scientific gradients, so they can't be used to demonstrate the continuous tone of colors in a natural photograph.5) What are the advantages and disadvantages of direct view storage tubes?Advantages:Refreshing is not necessarily.Without flicker, very complex images can be exhibit at very high resolution.Refreshing of the screen is not needed.Disadvantages:They normally never display color.Selected part of the picture never deleted.It can take quite a few second for composite images while redrawing and eliminating the process.Click here for more information6) Define Aspect Ratio?Aspect ratio is the ratio of the vertical points to horizontal points essential to produce equivalent length line in both direction on the screen.

In adding to the dynamic area with translations or rotations, computer-generated animations could exhibit time innovation in object dimension, color, transparency, or surface texture. Animations often transition from one object shape to another.Click here for more information23) Define Keyframe systems.Key-frame systems are specialized animation languages designed to generate the in-between frames from user-specified keyframes. Each object in the scene is described as a set of rigid bodies connected at the joints and with a limited number of degree of freedom. In-between frames are generated from the specification of two or more fey frames. Motion paths can be given by kinematic description as a set of spline curves or physically based by specifying the force acting on the object to be animated.24) What is Fractals?Fractals are those who have the property of a shape that has the same degree of roughness no matter how much it is magnified.

The boundary of the fractal is called the Julia set.It is the black inner fragment, which develops to consist of a cardioid along with several wart-like circles glued to it. Its border is complicated, and this complexity can be explored by zooming in on a portion of the borderJulia sets are extremely complicated sets of points in the complex plane. There is a various Julia set Jc for each value of c.28) What is the Koch curve?The Koch curve can be drawn by separate line into 4 equal segments with scaling method 1/3., and middle 2 segments are so adapted that they form adjustment sides of an equilateral triangle.29) What are Morphing and tweening?Transformation of object shape from one form to another is known as morphing.Tweening is the process, which applies to animation objects defined by a sequence of points, and that change shape from frame to frame.30) What are Peano curves?A fractal curve can fill the plane and therefore have a dimension of two. Such curves are called Peano curves.31) What is a Scripting system?Scripting systems allow object specifications and animation sequences to be defined with a user input string. From the script, a library of different objects and motions can be constructed.32) Define refresh/frame buffer.Picture definition is saved in a memory area known as the refresh buffer or frame buffer. This memory area keeps the set of intensity values for all the screen points.The frame buffer is where the image generation data is stored in the method of Video Display Monitors like CRT, Raster Scan, Random Scan, LCD, LED, etc.33) What is the resolutions?The maximum number of point that can be presented without overlap on a Cathode Ray Tube is indicated to as the resolutions.Resolution is the number of points per centimeters which can be plotted crosswise and vertically, although it is established as the total number of points in each direction.34) Define Window and viewport.A world-coordinate area selected for display is known as a window.An area on the display device to which a windows is mapped is known as a viewport.35) Distinguish between window port and viewport?A portion of a picture that is to be presented by a window is known as Window port.The display method of the part selected or the design in which the selected element is viewed is called a viewport.36) What are blobby objects?Some objects do not provide a fixed shape but change their surface features in certain motions or when in proximity to other objects. These objects are called as blobby objects since their shapes display a certain degree of fluidness.37) What are the Spline curves?The name spline is a flexible strip used to generate a smooth curve through a designated set of points. In computer Graphics, the name spline curves define to any combined curve create with polynomial portions fulfilling specified continuity methods at the edge of the pieces.38) What is the advantages of B spline over Bezier curve?The degree of B-spline polynomial can be set separately of the number of control points.B-Spline allows local authority over the shape of a spline curve or surface.A Bezier curve is a particular polynomial task, usually either cubic or quadratic, that describes a curve that goes from point A to point B given some control points in between. A Bezier spline is a collection of n of these.39) What is a Rasterizations?The phase of determining the appropriate pixels for representing images or graphics object is called a rasterization.40) How will you represent a curve in graphics?The curve can be created from an input set of mathematical tasks defining the objects or from a set of user-specified points. When tasks are specified, a package can project the describing equations for a curve to the display plane and plot pixel methods along the path of the projected plane.41) Mention the uses of Chromaticity Diagram?The chromaticity diagram is generally used to calculate a color against a gamut. The assumption is that if the chromaticity of the color distortion within the gamut line, then the color maybe copied on that device, or maybe described by that color system.42) What is interactive computer Graphics?Interactive computer Graphics like a website, it is only beneficial if a visitor browser it and no two visitors are precisely alike.

The term of the model comes from the labels of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The main objective of the RGB color model is for the sensing, defining, and display of pictures in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been utilizing in conventional photography.44) What is VDU?A monitor or display known as a visual display unit is a portion of electrical machinery which displays images created by an appliance such as computers, without producing a permanent data. The monitor composes the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is usually a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), while previous monitors use a cathode ray tube (CRT).45) What is Projection?The process of displaying 3D into a 2D display unit is called a projection.
