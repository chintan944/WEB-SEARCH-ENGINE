They may look the same and have some similar applications but they are entirely different from each other when it comes to taste, nutrition and appearance. Let us see how cabbage differs from lettuce!Cabbage:Cabbage is a small plant with a short stem and a bulb-shaped leafy head. It can be green, red or purple with many layers of leaves; the outer leaves are hard, whereas the inner ones are soft. It is for this reason that the inner leaves are eaten most than the outer leaves.Cabbage belongs to genus Brassica. Its scientific name is Brassica oleracea. It belongs to the family of cruciferous vegetables so can be grouped together with broccoli and cauliflower. It is grown in winters as it grows best at cool temperatures; however, some of its varieties can be grown in different areas with warm climate as long as the pH of the soil is below 6.5. The cabbage plant needs to be kept moist while it is growing as its roots tend to dry out easily.Cabbage is a rich source of vitamin C. It also contains vitamin B6, protein, glutamine and other active compounds. It tastes slightly more bitter and is more fibrous than lettuce but less crunchy. It is generally boiled or steamed instead of eaten fresh due to its harder outside leaves. It is used in the preparation of various dishes across the world.Lettuce:Lettuce is a green leafy vegetable, a small plant with a short stem and green leaves tightly wrapped around one another. It is grown in sandy soil with a pH between 6 and 7. It needs to be grown in the shade so farmers usually hang a mesh over their cabbage plants to protect them from the scorching sun. Furthermore, it also needs to be kept moist as its leaves may wilt if it is not kept watered.Lettuce has fewer calories than cabbage, e.g. only 15 calories in a 100-gram sample. It also has less dietary fibers and less vitamin C than cabbage. It is easy to chew with a neutral taste and is more similar to spinach than broccoli or cauliflower.Lettuce can be eaten raw as it has crunchy, soft texture and high water content. It is often used in salads and burgers. It is greener than cabbage due to the higher chlorophyll content in its leaves.Based on the above information, some of the key differences between Cabbage and lettuce are as follows:CabbageLettuceIt is a small plant with short stem and a leafy head that has many layers of leaves.It is a small plant with short stem and thick green leaves that wrap tightly around one another.Scientific name: Brassica oleracea.Scientific name: Lactuca sativa.It belongs to Brassicaceae family.It belongs to Asteraceae family.It is grown during winters in cool temperatures.It is grown during hot weather.Cabbage has red or purple variants.Lettuce does not have any colour variant.It is less green than lettuce.It is greener than cabbage.It is rich in Vitamin C and dietary fibers.It is rich in vitamin A and folic acid.It is generally cooked before eating.It is consumed raw.Its leaves tend to become softer as you move towards the center of the cabbage head.Its leaves tend to become firmer as you move towards the center of the lettuce head.Cabbage has a fragrance.Lettuce doesn't have a fragrance.Next TopicDifference between? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
