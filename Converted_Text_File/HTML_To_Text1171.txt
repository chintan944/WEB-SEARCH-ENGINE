Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.It can be defined by the following ways:Mother languageSystem programming languageProcedure-oriented programming languageStructured programming languageMid-level programming language1) C as a mother languageC language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.2) C as a system programming languageA system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. For example, Linux kernel is written in C.It can't be used for internet programming like Java, .Net, PHP, etc.3) C as a procedural languageA procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem.A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.4) C as a structured programming languageA structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.5) C as a mid-level programming languageC is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.A High-Level language is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.C ProgramIn this tutorial, all C programs are given with C compiler so that you can quickly change the C program code.File: main.c#include 
int main() {
printf("Hello C Programming\n");
return 0;
}A detailed description of above program is given in next chapters.C Programming IndexC TutorialWhat is C LanguageHistory of C Features of CHow to install CFirst C ProgramFlow of C Programprintf scanfVariables in CData Types in cKeywords in cC OperatorsC CommentsC Escape SequenceConstants in CC Fundamental TestC Control StatementsC if-elseC switchC LoopsC do-while loopC while loopC for loopC breakC continueC gotoType CastingC Control Statement TestC FunctionsWhat is functionCall: Value & ReferenceRecursion in cStorage ClassesC Functions TestC Array1-D Array2-D ArrayArray to FunctionC Array TestC PointersC PointersC Pointer to PointerC Pointer ArithmeticC Pointers TestC Dynamic MemoryDynamic memoryC StringsString in CC gets() & puts()C String FunctionsC strlen()C strcpy()C strcat()C strcmp()C strrev()C strlwr()C strupr()C strstr()C String TestC MathC Math FunctionsC Structure UnionC StructureC Array of StructuresC Nested StructureC UnionC Structure TestC File HandlingC File HandlingC fprintf() fscanf()C fputc() fgetc()C fputs() fgets()C fseek()C rewind()C ftell()C PreprocessorC PreprocessorC MacrosC #includeC #defineC #undefC #ifdefC #ifndefC #ifC #elseC #errorC #pragmaC Preprocessor TestC Command LineCommand Line ArgumentsC Programming TestC Programming TestC ProgramsTop 10+ C ProgramsFibonacci SeriesPrime NumberPalindrome NumberFactorialArmstrong NumberSum of digitsReverse NumberSwap NumberPrint "Hello" without ;Assembly code in CC program without mainMatrix MultiplicationDecimal to BinaryNumber in CharactersAlphabet TriangleNumber TriangleFibonacci TriangleC Programming TestC Programming TestC Fundamental TestC Fundamental 1C Fundamental 2C Fundamental 3C Fundamental 4C Control TestC Control Statement 1C Control Statement 2C Control Statement 3C Control Statement 4C Function TestC Functions 1C Functions 2C Functions 3C Functions 4C Array TestC Array 1C Array 2C Array 3C Array 4C Pointers TestC Pointers 1C Pointers 2C Pointers 3C Pointers 4C String TestC String 1C String 2C String 3C String 4C Structure TestC Structure 1C Structure 2C Structure 3C Structure 4C Preprocessor TestC Preprocessor 1C Preprocessor 2C Preprocessor 3C Preprocessor 4C InterviewC Interview QuestionsPrerequisiteBefore learning C Programming, you must have the basic knowledge of Computer Fundamental.AudienceOur C Programming tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.ProblemWe assure that you will not find any mistake in this C Language Tutorial.
