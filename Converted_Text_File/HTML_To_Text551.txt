Let q1 be the initial state.2. There are q2, q3, q4 ....qn number of states. The final state may be some qj where j= n.3. Let ?ji represents the transition from qj to qi.4. Calculate qi such that   qi =   ?ji  *   qj
If qj is a start state then we have:   qi = ?ji *  qj + ?5. Similarly, compute the final state which ultimately gives the regular expression 'r'.Example:Construct the regular expression for the given DFASolution:Let us write down the equationsq1 = q1 0 + ? Since q1 is the start state, so ? will be added, and the input 0 is coming to q1 from q1 hence we writeState = source state of input × input coming to itSimilarly,q2 = q1 1 + q2 1
q3 = q2 0 + q3 (0+1)Since the final states are q1 and q2, we are interested in solving q1 and q2 only. Let us see q1 firstq1 =  q1 0 + ?We can re-write it asq1 = ? + q1 0Which is similar to R = Q + RP, and gets reduced to R = OP*.Assuming R = q1, Q = ?, P = 0We getq1 = ?.(0)*
q1 = 0*    (?.R*= R*)Substituting the value into q2, we will getq2 = 0* 1 + q2 1
q2 = 0* 1 (1)*   (R = Q + RP  ?  Q P*)

The regular expression is given byr = q1 + q2
= 0* + 0* 1.1*
r = 0* + 0* 1+    (1.1* = 1+)Next TopicMoore Machine? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
