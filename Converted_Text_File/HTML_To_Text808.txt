After sign in, the screen appears is shown below:Move to the S3 services. After clicking on S3, the screen appears is shown below:To create an S3 bucket, click on the "Create bucket". On clicking the "Create bucket" button, the screen appears is shown below:Enter the bucket name which should look like DNS address, and it should be resolvable. A bucket is like a folder that stores the objects. A bucket name should be unique. A bucket name should start with the lowercase letter, must not contain any invalid characters. It should be 3 to 63 characters long.Click on the "Create" button. Now, the bucket is created.We have seen from the above screen that bucket and its objects are not public as by default, all the objects are private.Now, click on the "javatpointbucket" to upload a file in this bucket.
