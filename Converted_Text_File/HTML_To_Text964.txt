The flow of control enters at the beginning of the statement and leave at the end without any halt (except may be the last instruction of the block).The following sequence of three address statements forms a basic block:t1:= x * x
t2:= x * y
t3:= 2 * t2
t4:= t1 + t3
t5:= y * y
t6:= t4 + t5Basic block construction:Algorithm: Partition into basic blocksInput: It contains the sequence of three address statementsOutput: it contains a list of basic blocks with each three address statement in exactly one blockMethod: First identify the leader in the code. The rules for finding leaders are as follows:The first statement is a leader.Statement L is a leader if there is an conditional or unconditional goto statement like: if....goto L or goto LInstruction L is a leader if it immediately follows a goto or conditional goto statement like: if goto B or goto BFor each leader, its basic block consists of the leader and all statement up to. It doesn't include the next leader or end of the program.Consider the following source code for dot product of two vectors a and b of length 10:begin 
           prod :=0; 
i:=1; 
do begin 
prod :=prod+ a[i] * b[i]; 
i :=i+1; 
end 
while i <= 10 
endThe three address code for the above source program is given below:B1(1)	prod := 0 
(2)	i := 1B2(3)	t1 := 4* i 
(4)	t2 := a[t1] 
(5)	t3 := 4* i 
(6)	t4 := b[t3] 
(7)	t5 := t2*t4 
(8)	t6 := prod+t5 
(9)	prod := t6 
(10)	t7 := i+1 
(11)	i := t7 
(12)	if i<=10 goto (3)	Basic block B1 contains the statement (1) to (2)Basic block B2 contains the statement (3) to (12)Next TopicFlow Graph? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
