A simple command, e.g., "echo Hello $Var_Name' will print "Hello...the value of the variable as defined'. Bash will print nothing if the box is empty or not created. That is why it is important to make sure whether a variable is set properly or not while creating any bash script.Variables can be categorized into two parts:Defined VariablesVariables which are properly created or initialized, are known as Defined Variables. These may have zero value or an empty string.Undefined VariablesVariables which are never created or initialized, are known as Undefined Variables.To confirm whether a variable is set or not in Bash Scripting, we can use -v var or -z ${var} options as an expression with the combination of 'if' conditional command.SyntaxFollowing are the syntaxes of boolean expression which can be used to check if the variable is set:[[ -v Variable_Name ]]

[[ -z Variable_Name ]]The boolean expression returns 'True' if the variable is set and 'False' if the variable is not set.Following are the examples to check whether a variable is set or not:Using -v Option#!/bin/bash
#Script to check whether a variable is set or not using -v option

A=100
#A: variable is set.

if [[ -v A ]];
then
echo "Variable having name 'A' is already set."
else
echo "Variable having name 'A' is not set."
fi

#B: variable is not set
if [[ -v B ]];
then
echo "Variable having name 'B' is already set."
else
echo "Variable having name 'B' is not set."
fiOutputHere, variable 'A' is defined and assigned a value of 100 and hence is considered as 'set variable'. For variable 'B', we have not defined or assigned any value. As a result, the variable 'B' is not considered as 'set variable'.Using -z Option#!/bin/bash
#Script to check whether a variable is set or not using -z option

A=100
#A: variable is set.
if [[ -z ${A} ]];
then
echo "Variable having name 'A' is not set."
else
echo "Variable having name 'A' is already set."
fi

#B: variable is not set
if [[ -z ${B} ]];
then
echo "Variable having name 'B' is not set."
else
echo "Variable having name 'B' is already set."
fiOutputNote: There is a difference between an unset variable and a variable with a null value.Check out the following example demonstrating that the variable with a null value can be a set variable.ExampleVAR=''

#VAR is set

if [ -z ${VAR+x} ]; 
then 
echo "'VAR' is unset"; 
else 
echo "'VAR' is set, its content is '$VAR'"; 
fi

#Var is not set
if [ -z ${Var+x} ]; 
then 
echo "'Var' is unset"; 
else 
echo "'Var' is set, its content is '$Var'"; 
fiOutputThese are the commonly used methods that can be used to check if a variable is set or not.Next TopicBash Alias? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
