It is one of the common requirement for any programming language. A special character or built-in function is applied to perform string concatenation. However, Bash does not contain any built-in function to combine string data or variables. The easiest method to perform string concatenation in bash is to write variables side by side.For example, assume that we have two strings (i.e., "welcome" & "to javatpoint"), and we join both the strings together and a new string ("welcome to javatpoint") is created. This concept is referred to as String Concatenation.CommandThe example command for concatenating the strings can be defined as:str3="$str1$str2"Note: Observe the above command; there should not be any space before or after the assignment (=) operator. 'str' is used to indicate strings.This command will concatenate the values of str1 and str2 and store it in a third variable str3.Following are some examples demonstrating the different ways of string concatenation:Example 1: Write Variables Side by SideThis is the basic example of String Concatenation, and we do not need any extra operator or function in this method.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Script to Concatenate Strings

#Declaring the first String 
str1="We welcome you"

#Declaring the Second String
str2=" on Javatpoint."

#Combining first and second string
str3="$str1$str2"

#Printing a new string by combining both 
echo $str3OutputWe welcome you on Javatpoint.Example 2: Using Double QuotesAnother easy method is to use variables inside the string, which is defined with double-quotes. The string variable can be applied in any position of the string data.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
#Script to Concatenate Strings

#Declaring String Variable
str="We welcome you"

#Add the variable within the string
echo "$str on Javatpoint."OutputWe welcome you on Javatpoint.Example 3: Using Append Operator with LoopMost of the popular programming languages provide support for append operator (+=) which is the combination of the plus and equal sign. It will add new strings to the end of the string variable.Bash Script#!/bin/bash
echo "Printing the name of the programming languages"
#Initializing the variable before combining
lang=""
#for loop for reading the list
for value in 'java''python''C''C++';
do
lang+="$value "  #Combining the list values using append operator
done
#Printing the combined values
echo "$lang"OutputExample 4: Using the Printf FunctionIn bash, printf is a function which is used to print and concatenate the strings.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

str="Welcome"
printf -v new_str "$str to Javatpoint."
echo $new_strOutputWelcome to Javatpoint.Example 5: Using Literal StringsString concatenation can also be performed with a literal string by using curly braces{}. They should be used in such a way that the variable does not mix up with the literal string.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

str="Welcome to"

newstr="${str} Javatpoint."
echo "$newstr"OutputWelcome to Javatpoint.Example 6: Using UnderscoreUsing underscore for concatenating the string in bash shell is one of the common tasks. It is mostly used for assigning a name to the files.Bash Script#!/bin/bash

str1="Hello"
str2="World!"

echo "${str1}_${str2}"OutputHello_World!Example 7: Using any CharacterBash Script#!/bin/bash
#String Concatenation by Character (,) with User Input

read -p "Enter First Name: " name
read -p "Enter State: " state
read -p "Enter Age: " age

combine="$name,$state,$age"

echo "Name, State, Age: $combine"OutputConclusionString Concatenation is one of the required features in the programming languages to generate meaningful output. Almost all the possible ways of joining the strings in bash are explained in this topic.Next TopicBash Functions? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
