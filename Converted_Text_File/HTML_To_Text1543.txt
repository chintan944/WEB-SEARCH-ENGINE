Together these tools can be powerful.Post Exploitation: Tools that assist in maintaining the access of a system or need to extend control by laterally moving across the network.Forensics: It is a live boot environment that contains the tools that help us in full analysis and case management.Reporting Tools: It includes the tools that bring the data together, which is collected from various information-gathering tools and discover unreliable relationships.Social Engineer Tools: Tools that work as a medic during attacks. Such as, a USB key that is plugged in, which contains a harmful pdf, or it was also a Trojan horse that installed a backdoor. Or any banking website, in which the accountant is logged-in contains a perfect copy used for phishing purposes.System Service: It includes the tools that allow you to start and stop applications that run in the background as system services.Kali Linux configurationHow to configure Network in Kali Linux1. On the Desktop with NetworkManager: In Kali Linux, the NetworkManager is already installed and can be configured through GNOME's control center or through the top-right menu on Desktop as shown in Figure below.2. On the Command-line with "ifupdown" command: When we want to configure the network settings without using the graphical desktop, we can use the command-line with the already-installed package i.e., ifupdown. It has Ifup and Ifdown tool. The network device can be removed at any time with the ifdown network device. And can modify and back up the network using the ifup network device.And for wireless interfaces, we need the wpasupplicant package, which is included in Kali by default. The most commonly used options are WPA-SSID (defines the name of the wireless network to join) and WPA-PSK (defines the key protecting the network).Note: You must provide more details such as IP address, the network, and the IP of the gateway for the fixed IP address configuration.3. On the Command-line with "systemd-networkd" command: The ifupdown approach is a legacy tool used by Debian but still used as the default for server and other minimal installations. The new tool is introduced in the Kali for Network Configuration, which is systemd-networkd. It's integration with the init system makes it an attractive choice. You can configure these by placing the network files into the /etc/systemd/network/directory.How to update Kali LinuxStep 1: We need to configure Kali Linux Repositories. /etc/apt/sources.list file must contain the following official Kali repositories:deb https://http.Kali.org/Kali Kali-rolling main non-free contrib
deb-sources https://http.Kali.org/Kali Kali-rolling main non-free contribStep 2: Updating Kali Linux by first updating the package list. Open terminal and enter:$ sudo apt updateStep 3: After updating the package list, update kept back packages$ sudo apt dist-upgradeStep 4: Uninstall those packages that are no longer required.$ sudo apt autoremoveNext TopicKali Linux Commands? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
