It is a surgical procedure for treating severe coronary heart disease in which blood flow to the heart muscles is interrupted due to a blockage. So, it is mainly performed to improve the blood flow to the heart and thereby reduce the chances of a heart attack. The CHD is caused when a waxy substance (plaque) builds up inside the coronary arteries which supply oxygenated blood to the heart. Over time, the plaque may harden and narrow the arteries and thus can interrupt the flow of oxygenated blood to the heart. It usually results in chest pain called angina.In CABG, a new route is created around the blocked artery so that blood could be sent to the heart muscle through this route. In this procedure, a piece of vein from some other part of your body is used to bypass the blocked portion of the coronary artery. Usually, a healthy piece of vein from the leg or a piece of artery in the chest or wrist is taken and then attached to the affected coronary artery just above and below the blocked area of the artery to bypass the blockage.Purpose of CABGTo restore blood flow to the heart musclesTo reduce chest pain and ischemiaTo improve quality of lifeTo reduce the risk of heart attackCommon symptomsChest painSevere TirednessPalpitationsAbnormal heart rhythmsShortness of breathSwollen hands or feetIndigestionComplicationsHypothermia ( low body temperature)Bradycardia (slow heart rate)Tachydysrhythmias (abnormal cardiac rhythm)Cardiac failureFluid overloadAcute renal failureHepatic failureNext TopicFull Form? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
