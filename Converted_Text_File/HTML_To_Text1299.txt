This model is built on the infrastructure model and provide resources like computers, storage and network. It is responsible to provide complete virtualization of the infrastructure layer, make it look like a single server and invisible for outside world.10) What is on-demand functionality? How is it provided in cloud computing?Cloud computing provides a on-demand access to the virtualized IT resources. It can be used by the subscriber. It uses shared pool to provide configurable resources. Shared pool contains networks, servers, storage, applications and services.11) What are the platforms used for large scale cloud computing?Apache Hadoop and MapReduce are the platforms use for large scale cloud computing.12) What are the different models for deployment in cloud computing?These are the different deployment model in cloud computing:Private cloudPublic cloudHybrid cloudCommunity cloud13) What is private cloud?Private clouds are used to keep the strategic operations and other reasons secure. It is a complete platform which is fully functional and can be owned, operated and restricted to only an organization or an industry. Now a day, most of the organizations have moved to private clouds due to security concerns. Virtual private cloud is being used that operate by a hosting company.14) What is public cloud?The public clouds are open to the people for use and deployment. For example: Google and Amazon etc. The public clouds focus on a few layers like cloud application, infrastructure providing and providing platform markets.15) What are Hybrid clouds?Hybrid clouds are the combination of public clouds and private clouds. It is preferred over both the clouds because it applies most robust approach to implement cloud architecture. It includes the functionalities and features of both the worlds. It allows organizations to create their own cloud and allow them to give the control over to someone else as well.16) What is the difference between cloud computing and mobile computing?Mobile computing and cloud computing are slightly same in concept. Mobile computing uses the concept of cloud computing . Cloud computing provides users the data which they required while in mobile computing, applications run on the remote server and gives user the access for storage and manage.17) What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?Scalability is a characteristic of cloud computing which is used to handle the increasing workload by increasing in proportion amount of resource capacity. By the use of scalability, the architecture provides on demand resources if the requirement is being raised by the traffic. Whereas, Elasticity is a characteristic which provides the concept of commissioning and decommissioning of large amount of resource capacity dynamically. It is measured by the speed by which the resources are coming on demand and the usage of the resources.18) What are the security benefits of cloud computing?Cloud computing authorizes the application service, so it is used in identity management.It provides permissions to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.19) What is the usage of utility computing?Utility computing is a plug-in managed by an organization which decides what type of services has to be deployed from the cloud.
