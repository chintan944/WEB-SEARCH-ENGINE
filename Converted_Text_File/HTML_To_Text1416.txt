That is, R is a subset of A × B and S is a subset of B × C. Then R and S give rise to a relation from A to C indicated by R?S and defined by:     a (R?S)c if for some b ? B we have aRb and bSc. 
That is, 
     R ? S = {(a, c)| there exists b ? B for which (a, b) ? R and (b, c) ? S} The relation R?S is known the composition of R and S; it is sometimes denoted simply by RS.Let R is a relation on a set A, that is, R is a relation from a set A to itself. Then R?R, the composition of R with itself, is always represented. Also, R?R is sometimes denoted by R2. Similarly, R3 = R2?R = R?R?R, and so on. Thus Rn is defined for all positive n.Example1: Let X = {4, 5, 6}, Y = {a, b, c} and Z = {l, m, n}. Consider the relation R1 from X to Y and R2 from Y to Z. R1 = {(4, a), (4, b), (5, c), (6, a), (6, c)}
 R2 = {(a, l), (a, n), (b, l), (b, m), (c, l), (c, m), (c, n)}Find the composition of relation (i) R1 o R2 (ii) R1o R1-1Solution: (i) The composition relation R1 o R2 as shown in fig:R1 o R2 = {(4, l), (4, n), (4, m), (5, l), (5, m), (5, n), (6, l), (6, m), (6, n)}(ii) The composition relation R1o R1-1 as shown in fig:R1o R1-1 = {(4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6)}Composition of Relations and MatricesThere is another way of finding R?S. Let MR and MS denote respectively the matrix representations of the relations R and S. ThenExample Let P = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Consider the relation R and S on P defined by
    R = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3)}
    S = {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 5)}.

        Find the matrices of the above relations.
Use matrices to find the following composition of the relation R and S.
  (i)RoS       (ii)RoR       (iii)SoRSolution: The matrices of the relation R and S are a shown in fig:(i) To obtain the composition of relation R and S. First multiply MR with MS to obtain the matrix MR x MS as shown in fig:The non zero entries in the matrix MR x MS tells the elements related in RoS. So,Hence the composition R o S of the relation R and S isR o S = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}.(ii) First, multiply the matrix MR by itself, as shown in figHence the composition R o R of the relation R and S isR o R = {(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)}(iii) Multiply the matrix MS with MR to obtain the matrix MS x MR as shown in fig:The non-zero entries in matrix MS x MR tells the elements related in S o R.Hence the composition S o R of the relation S and R isS o R = {(2, 4) , (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}.Next TopicTypes of Relations? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
