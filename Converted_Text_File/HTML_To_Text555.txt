The property of a rectangle is that the length of the opposite sides must be equal. We can find the area of a rectangle by using the formula that includes height and width.In this section, we will learn how to find the area of a rectangle and will try to understand through examples given in the last of this section.DefinitionThe area of a rectangle is the reign covered by a rectangle in a 2D plane. In other words, the width multiplied by its height. The unit of area is square units.Area of Rectangle FormulaWe can calculate the area of a rectangle if we know its height and length.Area of rectangle (A) = w * hWhere w represents the width, and h represents the height.Sometimes we have given diagonal and width of a rectangle. Then we apply the following formula to find the area of a rectangle.Area of rectangle (A) = width?diagonal2-width2 Properties of RectangleAll sides of a rectangle are parallel and equal to each other.Each right angle is 90° degrees.All sides have equal length.A square is always a rectangle.In the above figure, the red color sides are of the same length and parallel to each other. Similarly, the green color sides are of the same length and parallel to each other. The right angle inside the rectangle denotes the angle, each of 90°.ExampleWhen width and height are givenExample 1: Find the area of a rectangle whose height is 5 m and width is 9 m.Solution:Given, h=5 m and w=9 mWe know that,area of rectangle (A) = w * hputting the values in the above formula, we getA = 9 * 5A = 45 m2The area of the rectangle is 45 m2.When diagonal and width is givenExample 2: Find the area of a rectangular board whose diagonal length is 20 cm and width is 13 cm.Solution:Given, length of diagonal (d) = 20 and width is 13 cmWe know that,Area of rectangle (A) = width?diagonal2-width2A = 13 ?202-1322A = 13 ?(400-169)A = 13 ?231A = 13 * 15.19A = 197.58 cm2The area of rectangle is 197.58 cm2.Using Pythagoras theorem Example 3: If the diagonal of a rectangle ABCD is 100 cm and its length x is twice its width y. Find the area of the rectangle.Solution:Given, diagonal (d) = 100 cm and width (x)= 2yAccording to the Pythagoras theorem:Hypotenuse=?base2+perpendicular2Putting the values in the above equation, we get:1002= y2 + (2y)21002= y2 + 4y21002= 5y2on solving the above equation,y=20?5putting the value of y in width, we get:x = 40?5 cm.we know that,Area of triangle (A) = width * heightSince,A = 40?5 cm2The area of rectangle is 40?5 cm2.Next TopicArea of trapezoid? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
