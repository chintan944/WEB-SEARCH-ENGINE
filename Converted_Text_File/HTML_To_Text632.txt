It is used to retrieve and store model state in a database such as SQL Server database. It also used for business logic separation from the data in the application.ViewView: View is a component that forms the application's user interface. It is uses to create web pages for the application. An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes, drop-down lists and check boxes based on the current state of a Product object.ControllerController: Controller is the component which handles user interaction. It works with the model and selects the view to render the web page. In an MVC application, the view only displays information whereas the controller handles and responds to the user input and requests.The following image represents the ASP.NET MVC Design Pattern:This design pattern is a lightweight framework which is integrated with various features such as master pages and membership based authentication. It is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly.Advantages of ASP.NET MVC FrameworkThis approach provides the following advantages.It manages application complexity by dividing an application into the model, view and controller.It does not use view state or server-based forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.It provides better support for test-driven development.It is suitable for large scale developer team and web applications.It provides high degree of control to the developer over the application behavior.Next TopicASP.NET MVC Project? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
