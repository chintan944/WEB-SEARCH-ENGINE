We can use these to deal with data, files, path etc and can also be used as service.TypeDescriptionClassFileSetIt is used to create Jar with all required classes.DirSetIt groups the directories.FileListA list of files.FileSetA group of files.FileMapperIt helps to map source and target file.FilterSetA group of filters.PatternSetA group of patterns that are referenced by ids.SelectorsA FileSet element, helps to select elementsTarFileSetIt is a special form of a FileSet.ZipFileSetA set of zip files.ClassFileSetClassFileSet is a special type of FileSet which includes all of the class files upon which the root classes are depend. It is used to create JAR with all the required classes for a particular application.ClassFileSet are declared by the id value which is then used as reference.DirSetA DirSet is a group of directories. It supports <patternset> and it's nested elements <include>, <includesfile>, <exclude>, <excludefiles>. It has various attributes which are given below.AttributeDescriptionRequireddirIt holds root of the directory tree of this DirSetYesincludesA list of patterns of directories.NoincludesfileName of a file which is to be included.NoexcludesA list of patterns of directories that must be excluded.NoexcludesfileName of a file which is to be excluded.NocasesensitiveIt is used to specify whether case-sensitivity should be applied or not.NofollosymlinksIt holds a symbolic link to be followed.NoerroronmissingdirIt specifies what happens if the base directory does not exist.NoApache Ant DirSet Example<dirset dir="${build.dir}">
  <include name="apps/**/classes"/>
  <exclude name="apps/**/*Test*"/>
</dirset>This example will group all the directories names classess found inside the apps subdirectory of ${build.dir} and excludes which has test in their name.FileListFileList is a list (collection) of files. It can be be used with <concat>, <dependset> tasks. FileList is useful for specifying files that may or may not exists. It has attributes given below.AttributeDescriptionRequireddirIt is used to hold base directory of this list.YesfilesList of file namesYesFileList Example<project name="filelist" default="filelist-run">
<target name = ?filelist-run?>
		<filelist id="files" dir="${files.src}" files="a.xml,b.xml"/>
	</target>
</project>FileSetFileSet is a group of files from a single root directory. It collects files based on patternsets specified by Ant. The <include> and <exclude> elements are called patternsets. A patternset is a collection of file matching patterns. By default these are casesensitive, but can be disabled by setting casesensitive = false.File Set has attributes which are given below.AttributeDescriptionRequireddirIt holds root directory the FileSet.Either dir or file must be specified.fileFor specifying a single-file fileset.Either dir or file must be specified.includesA list of patterns of files that must be included.NoincludesfileA file name.NoexcludesA list of patterns of files that must be excluded.NoexcludesfilesA File name pattern.NocasesensitiveBoth the include and exclude patterns are casesensitive.NofollowsymlinksThe symbolic links should be followed.NoLets see an example and copy files from one directory to another.FileSet Example// build.xml<project name="fileset" default="fileset-run">
	<target name="fileset-run">
		<copy todir="dir1">
			<fileset dir="dir2">
  				<include name ="*.java"/>
			</fileset>
		</copy>
	</target>
</project>The above code will copy all the java files from dir2 to dir1.FileMapperSometimes after executing a task, the source file and the output both are different and then not be mapped. Apache Ant uses FileMapper to map source and created target file. An instance of org.apache.tools.ant.util.FileNameMapper class and <mapper> element is used to map the files.The mapper has the following attributes.AttributeDescriptionRequiredtypespecifies one of the built-in implementations.Noclassnamespecifies the implementation by class name.Exactly one of these.classpaththe classpath to use when looking up classname.NoclasspathrefApache Ant? User ManualNofromthe from attribute for the given implementation.Depends on implementationtothe to attribute for the given implementation.Depends on implementationAll built-in mappers are case-sensitivity.Mapper Example<mapper type="glob" from="*.java" to="*.java.bak"/>
<globmapper from="*.java" to="*.java.bak"/>FilterSetFilterSet is a group of filters and used by two major operations (tasks) copy and move. It uses id and refid attributes, id is used to define a FilterSet and refid is used to refer another FilterSet.It is also possible to nest FilterSet into FilterSet to get a set union of the contained filters.It has various attributes which are given below.Fileset AttributesAttributeDescriptionDefaultRequiredbegintokenIt is a string marking the beginning of a token.@NoendtokenIt is a string marking the end of a token.@NofiltersfileIt specifies a single filtersfile.NoneNorecurseUsed for searched more tokens.trueNoonmissingfiltersfileIt Indicates behavior when a nonexistent filtersfile is specified.failNoHere, we are copying the abc.txt file to the dist directory from the build directory but wish to replace the token @DATE@ with today's date.FilterSet Example<copy file="${build.dir}/abc.txt" toFile="${dist.dir}/xyz.txt">
  <filterset>
    <filter token="DATE" value="${TODAY}"/>
  </filterset>
