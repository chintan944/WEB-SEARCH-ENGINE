It figures out which apps you are using in the next few hours.Google partnered with Deep Mind refine its deep learning algorithms, and it has big efforts on Android battery life.Adaptive brightnessAccording to Google, the current auto-brightness settings are not good enough; that is why it gives phone makers more power efficient to handle the screen brightness based on the environment.App actionsGoogle inserted more prediction tools into its app drawer. Previously you would see a top row of predicted apps based on your usage history.Android Pie goes one step further with app actions that predict what you will do next, and its shortcuts sit in a row right-bottom the predicted app icons. It is just like the Android Pie is reading your mind.Navigation changesAndroid Pie has a new navigation interface in order to perform multi-tasking easier, with a single clean home button. It is much similar to the iPhone X horizontal bar.You can swipe up from the bottom in the operating system to see the recent open apps as well as five predicted apps at the bottom of the screen to save your time.Android Pie lets you scroll through all of your apps very quickly by sliding right and left with the horizontal bar at the bottom.Volume slider and screen rotation fixedThe volume slider is moved in the Android Pie. This time it's off to the right side near the volume rocker. Pressing the volume key in Android Pie adjust the media volume instead of sometimes controlling the ringer volume. The ringer can be turned on and off through a toggle button when you adjust the volume.You can also control the screen orientation manually. This is done through a pop-up icon which appears when you rotate the screen.Android Pie vs. Android Oreo: SecurityThe latest Android Pie comes with some added security, which is not available in the previous Oreo version. The company has claimed that the background apps will not have microphone and camera access, it will surely protect the user's privacy.When the background app uses a microphone or camera, the OS will inform users via a notification.Selectable Dark ModeAndroid Oreo included the dark mode, but the system automatically decided whether to enable it based on your wallpaper. Now, in Android Pie, you can choose for yourself at Setting > System > Display > Advance > Device theme.Next TopicAndroid One? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
