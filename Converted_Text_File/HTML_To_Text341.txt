Pip needs to be installed". The pip module is not available on the remote server during the execution.Installing a Pip ModuleTo install a new python library, you need to set the name of the package against the "name" parameter. By default, the "state" parameter is "present", the module will try to install the library.If the library is already installed, then nothing will be done. And if a new version of the library exists, it will not be upgraded.- hosts: all

      name: NumPyInstalling Using a Requirement FileAnother way to install the libraries is via the requirements file. If you have any requirements file with all the libraries in the remote servers, give it as input to the "requirements" parameters.Also, you can use the copy module beforehand to copy the requirements file to every remote server. In the following code, install the requirements file in the location/tmp/req.txt.- hosts: all

      name: NumPy,SciPyInstalling a Particular Version of Pip LibraryThere is a "version" parameter, which can be used to install only the mentioned version of a library. In the following code, install the version of nltk library.- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Installing a required version of python library 
    pip:
      name: nltk
      version: '3.0.0'Reinstall a Python LibraryYou can reinstall the python library by using the "forcereinstall" value for the "state" parameter.This will reinstall the latest version of the library. You can use the "version" parameter along with it. The following code will install the version 3.0.0 of the nltk library.- hosts: all
