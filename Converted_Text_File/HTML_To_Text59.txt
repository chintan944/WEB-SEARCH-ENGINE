Agile development methodology and testing practices have worked wonders for numerous organizations with positive aspects. Its positive aspects are not hidden, it is very much visible in the organization.Advantages of Agile MethodologyCustomer satisfaction is rapid, continuous development and delivery of useful software.Customer, Developer, and Product Owner interact regularly to emphasize rather than processes and tools.Product is developed fast and frequently delivered (weeks rather than months.)A face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.It continuously gave attention to technical excellence and good design.Daily and close cooperation between business people and developers.Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.Disadvantages of Agile methodology:It is not useful for small development projects.There is a lack of intensity on necessary designing and documentation.It requires an expert project member to take crucial decisions in the meeting.Cost of Agile development methodology is slightly more as compared to other development methodology.The project can quickly go out off track if the project manager is not clear about requirements and what outcome he/she wants.Advantages of the Waterfall Model:It is one of the easiest and traditional model to manage. Because of its traditional development nature, each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.It works well in smaller size projects where requirements are easily understandable.It has a faster product delivery model.There are well-documented process and results.Easily adaptable method for shifting teamsThis project management methodology is beneficial to manage dependencies.Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:It is not an ideal model to develop a large scale project size.It requires a clear-cut requirement at the beginning time; otherwise, it may lead to a less effective method.It is difficult to move back to make changes in the previous phase.The testing process starts once development is completed. Hence, it has high chances of bugs to be found later in project development. Due to this, it is costly to fix.Compression between the Agile methodology and Waterfall model:Agile methodologyWaterfall modelIt follows the incremental approach.It is a sequential design process.It divides the project development lifecycle into a sprint.The software development process is divided into distinct phases.Agile methodology is a flexible methodology.The Waterfall is a structured software development methodology.Agile is the collection of many different projects.It is completed as one single project.The test plan is reviewed after each sprintTest plan is reviewed after complete development.Testing team can take part in the requirements change phase without problems.It is difficult for the test to initiate any change in needs.Next TopicAgile Manifesto? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
