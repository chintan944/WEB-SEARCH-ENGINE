There are libraries available in most programming languages for working with YAML.For Ansible, every YAML file starts with a list. Each item in the list is a list of key-value pairs, commonly called a "hash" or "dictionary". So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML.There’s another small quirk to YAML. All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) can optionally begin with --- and end with ---. This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "-" (a dash and space):---
# A list of colors
- White
- Orange
- Red
- Black
---We have different ways in which the YAML data is represented, such as:Key-value PairYAML uses the Key-Value pair to represent the data. And the dictionary is described in the key: value pair.NOTE: There should be space between: and value.For example, a student record---
# A student record
Martin:
name: Martin 
roll no: 10
class: 12th
div: A
---AbbreviationWe can also use the abbreviation to represent the directories:Martin: [name: martin, roll no: 10, class: 12th, div: A] Representing ListWe can also represent List in YAML. Every element (member) of the list should be written in a new line with the same indentation starting with "-" (- and space).For example: Name of the countries---
#Name of country 
Countries:  
   - India 
   - China 
   - USA
   - Iceland 
---AbbreviationTo represent the list, we can also use the abbreviation method:Countries: ['India', 'China', 'USA', 'Iceland']List inside Dictionaries We can use the list inside dictionaries, i.e., the value of a key is a list.For example, a student record---
# A student record
Martin:
name: Martin 
roll no: 10
class: 12th
div: A
likes:
- Physics 
- Chemistry
- Math 
---List of Directories We can also make a list of directories:For example: ---
# A student record
- Martin:
name: Martin 
roll no: 10
class: 12th
div: A
likes:
- Physics 
- Chemistry
- Math 
- Edward:
 name: Edward
 roll no: 11
class: 12th
div: A
likes: 
- Biology 
- English 
---YAML uses "|" to include newlines while showing multiple lines and ">" to suppress newlines while showing various lines. Due to this, we can read and edit long lines. In both cases, the indentation will be ignored.We can also represent Boolean (True/false) values in YAML, where Boolean values can be case insensitive.For example, a student result---  
#a student result 
- Martin:
name: Martin 
roll no: 10
class: 12th
div: A
likes:
- Physics 
- Chemistry
- Math 
   
   result: 
      Physics: 70 
     Chemistry: 45 
Math: 85
Biology: 65
      English: 80
