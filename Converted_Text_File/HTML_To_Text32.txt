Therefore, n1+n2 is the number of cases favorable to A or B.Example: Two dice are tossed once. Find the probability of getting an even number on first dice or a total of 8.Solution: An even number can be got on a die in 3 ways because any one of 2, 4, 6, can come. The other die can have any number. This can happen in 6 ways.        ? P (an even number on Ist die) = A total of 8 can be obtained in the following cases:                {(2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2)}        ?     P (a total of 8) =             ?     Total Probability =Theorem2: If A and B are two events that are not mutually exclusive, then                 P(A ?B)=P(A)+P(B)- P (A?B).Proof: Let n = total number of exhaustive cases                      n1=number of cases favorable to A                      n2= number of cases favorable to B                      n3= number of cases favorable to both A and BBut A and B are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, A and B can occur simultaneously. So,n1+n2-n3 is the number of cases favorable to A or B.Therefore, P(A ?B)=But we have, P(A)=, P(B) =and P (A?B)=Hence,       P(A ?B)=P(A)+P(B)- P (A?B).Example1: Two dice are tossed once. Find the probability of getting an even number on first dice or a total of 8.Solution: P(even number on Ist die or a total of 8) = P (even number on Ist die)+P (total of 8)= P(even number on Ist die and a total of 8)?    Now, P(even number on Ist die)= Ordered Pairs showing a total of 8 = {(6, 2), (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5), (2, 6)} = 5?       Probability; P(total of 8) = P(even number on Ist die and total of 8) = ?         Required Probability = Example2: Two dice are thrown. The events A, B, C, D, E, FA = getting even number on first die.B= getting an odd number on the first die.C = getting a sum of the number on dice ? 5D = getting a sum of the number on dice > 5 but less than 10.E = getting sum of the number on dice ? 10.F = getting odd number on one of the dice.Show the following:1. A, B are a mutually exclusive event and Exhaustive Event.2. A, C are not mutually exclusive.3. C, D are a mutually exclusive event but not Exhaustive Event.4. C, D, E are a mutually exclusive and exhaustive event.5. A'?B' are a mutually exclusive and exhaustive event.6.
