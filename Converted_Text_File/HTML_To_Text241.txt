These include different types of modules-Android app modulesLibrary modulesGoogle App Engine modulesBy default, Android Studio displays our project files in the Android project view, as shown in the above image. This view is formed by modules to provide quick access to our project's key source files.These build files are visible to the top-level under Gradle Scripts. And the app module contains the following folders:manifests: It contains the AndroidManifest.xml file.java: It contains the source code of Java files, including the JUnit test code.res: It contains all non-code resources, UI strings, XML layouts, and bitmap images.We will see the actual file structure of the project by selecting the Project from the Project dropdown.Android Studio User InterfaceThe Android Studio main window contains the several logical areas which are shown in the below figure:The toolbar provides us a wide range of actions, which includes running apps and launching Android tools.The navigation bar helps in navigating our project and open files for editing. It gives a compact view of structure visible in the Project window.The editor window is a space where we can create and modify our code. On the basis of the current file type, the editor can change. While viewing a layout file, the editor displays the Layout Editor.The tool window bar runs around the outside the IDE window and contains buttons that allow as to expand and collapse individual tool windows.The tool windows provide us access specific tasks like search, project management, version control, and more. We can able expand and collapse them.The status bar displays the status of our project and IDE itself, as well as any messages or warnings.We are willing to organize the main window to give ourselves more screen space by moving or hiding toolbars and tool windows. We can also use keyboard shortcuts to access most of the IDE features.Android Studio Tool windowWe can use keyboard shortcuts to open tool windows. The below table provides the list of shortcuts for the most common windows.Tool windowWindows and LinuxMacProjectAlt+1Command+1Version ControlAlt+9Command+9RunShift+F10Control+RDebugShift+F9Control+DLogcatAlt+6Command+6Return to EditorEscEscHide all Tool WindowsControl+Shift+F12Command+Shift+F12Gradle build systemGradle build used as the foundation of the build system in Android Studio. It uses more Android-specific capabilities provided by the Android plugin for Gradle. This build system runs independently from the command line and integrated tool from the Android Studio menu. We can use build features for the following purpose:Configure, customize, and extend the build process.We can create multiple APKs from our app, with different features using the same project and modules.Reuse resource and code across source sets.Next TopicAndroid Emulator? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
