Let P be a property of such relations, such as being symmetric or being transitive. A relation with property P will be called a P-relation. The P-closure of an arbitrary relation R on A, indicated P (R), is a P-relation such thatR ? P (R) ? S(1) Reflexive and Symmetric Closures: The next theorem tells us how to obtain the reflexive and symmetric closures of a relation easily.Theorem: Let R be a relation on a set A. Then:R ? ?A is the reflexive closure of RR ? R-1 is the symmetric closure of R.Example1:Let A = {k, l, m}. Let R is a relation on A defined by
    R = {(k, k), (k, l), (l, m), (m, k)}. Find the reflexive closure of R.Solution: R ? ? is the smallest relation having reflexive property, Hence,RF = R ? ? = {(k, k), (k, l), (l, l), (l, m), (m, m), (m, k)}.Example2: Consider the relation R on A = {4, 5, 6, 7} defined byR = {(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 7)}Find the symmetric closure of R.Solution: The smallest relation containing R having the symmetric property is R ? R-1,i.e.RS = R ? R-1 = {(4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 4), (4, 7), (7, 7)}.(2)Transitive Closures: Consider a relation R on a set A. The transitive closure R of a relation R of a relation R is the smallest transitive relation containing R.Recall that R2 = R? R and Rn = Rn-1 ? R. We defineThe following Theorem applies:Theorem1: R* is the transitive closure of RSuppose A is a finite set with n elements.R* = R ?R2  ?.....? Rn
Theorem 2: Let R be a relation on a set A with n elements. ThenTransitive (R) = R ? R2?.....? Rn
Example1: Consider the relation R = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)} on A = {1, 2, 3}. ThenR2 = R? R = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} and R3 = R2 ? R = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} Accordingly,Transitive (R) = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (1, 3)}Example2: Let A = {4, 6, 8, 10} and R = {(4, 4), (4, 10), (6, 6), (6, 8), (8, 10)} is a relation on set A. Determine transitive closure of R.Solution: The matrix of relation R is shown in fig:Now, find the powers of MR as in fig:Hence, the transitive closure of MR is MR* as shown in Fig (where MR* is the ORing of a power of MR).Thus, R* = {(4, 4), (4, 10), (6, 8), (6, 6), (6, 10), (8, 10)}.Note: While ORing the power of the matrix R, we can eliminate MRn because it is equal to MR* if n is even and is equal to MR3 if n is odd.Next TopicEquivalence Relations? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
