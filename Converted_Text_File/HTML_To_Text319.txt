Test it NowNote:You can also use the ng-repeat directive to make the same dropdown list as ng-options.See this example:
 
{{x}}The same example of dropdown list using the ng-repeat directive.Test it Nowng-options vs. ng-repeatAlthough, both can be used for dropdown list, but ng-repeat directive repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array, it can be used to create options in a dropdown list, while the ng-options directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with options, and has at least one important advantage:Dropdowns made with ng-options allows the selected value to be an object, while dropdowns made from ng-repeat has to be a string.Consider that you have an array of objects:$scope.cars = [
    {model : "Ford Mustang", color : "red"},
    {model : "Fiat 500", color : "white"},
    {model : "Volvo XC90", color : "black"}
];Limitation of ng-repeatThe ng-repeat directive has a limitation that the selected value must be a string:See this example:
Select a car:{{x.model}}You selected: {{selectedCar}}Test it NowWhile using the ng-options directive, you can select an object value:See this example:
Select a car:You selected: {{selectedCar.model}}It's color is: {{selectedCar.color}}Test it NowUse data source as an objectWe can also use data source as an object.Consider that you have an object with following key-value pairs:$scope.cars = {
        car01 : "Ford",
        car02 : "Honda",
        car03 : "Volvo",
        car03 : "Hundai",
    };The expression in the ng-options attribute is a bit different for objects:See this example:
Select a car:You selected: {{selectedCar}}Test it NowExample2:The selected value will always be the value in a key-value pair.The value in a key-value pair can also be an object:$scope.cars = {
car01 : {brand : "Ford", model : "Mustang", color : "red"},
car02 : {brand : "Honda", model : "city", color : "white"},
car03 : {brand : "Volvo", model : "XC90", color : "black"},
car04 : {brand : "Hundai", model : "Creta", color : "gray"}
};See this example:
Select a car:You selected: {{selectedCar.brand}}Model: {{selectedCar.model}}Color: {{selectedCar.color}}Test it NowNext TopicAngularJS DOM? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
