It takes input from the user and assigns it to the variable. It reads only a single line from the Bash shell. Below is the syntax for its implementation.Syntaxread <variable_name>Follow the given examples to read user input from the Bash Script:Example 1:In this example, we read both the single and multiple variables from the Bash Script by using read command.Program:#!/bin/bash

# Read the user input 

echo "Enter the user name: "
read first_name
echo "The Current User Name is $first_name"
echo
echo "Enter other users'names: "
read name1 name2 name3
echo "$name1, $name2, $name3 are the other users."See the Bash Console:Output:What will happen if we don't pass any variable with the read command?If we don't pass any variable with the read command, then we can pass a built-in variable called REPLY (should be prefixed with the $ sign) while displaying the input. It can be explained using the below program:Program:#!/bin/bash

# using read command without any variable

echo "Enter name : "

read

echo "Name : $REPLY"On Bash Console:Output:Example 2:In this example, we enter the input on the same PROMPT by using the -p command line option as follows:read -p PROMPT <variable_name>Program:#!/bin/bash

read -p "username:" user_var
echo "The username is: " $user_varSee the Bash Console:Output:Example 3:This example is to keep the input on silent mode, such that whatever be a user input on the command line will be hidden to others.So, we pass a username and hide the password (silent mode) by using the command line options (-s, -p) commonly as follows:read -sp PROMPT <variable_name>Where -s allows a user to keep the input on silent mode and -p to input on newly command prompt.Program:#!/bin/bash

read -p "username : " user_var
read -sp "password : " pass_var
echo
echo "username : " $user_var
echo "password : "  $pass_varSee the Bash Console:Output:NOTE: At the 5th line of the script, we have given a blanked line with echo command, because if we do not make it blank then, it will give output with both the password and username on the same PROMPT as the below image.So, write your script by adding a blank echo command line.Example 4: This example is to enter multiple inputs using an array. So use the -a command line option as follows:read -a <variable_name>Where -a helps script to read an array, and variable_name refers to an array.Program:#!/bin/bash

# Reading multiple inputs using an array

echo "Enter names : "
read -a names
echo "The entered names are : ${names[0]}, ${names[1]}."See the code on Bash Console:Output:Next TopicBash Date Format? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
