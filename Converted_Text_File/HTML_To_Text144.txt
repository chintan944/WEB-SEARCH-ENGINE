The images are manipulated by electrical signals. In analog image processing, analog signals can be periodic or non-periodicExamples of analog images are television images, photographs, paintings, and medical images etc.Digital Image ProcessingA digital image processing is applied to digital images (a matrix of small pixels and elements). For manipulating the images, there is a number of software and algorithms that are applied to perform changes. Digital image processing is one of the fastest growing industry which affects everyone's life.Examples of digital images are color processing, image recognition, video processing, etc.Conversion of the analog signal to a digital signal by digital image processingDigital signal processing is all about processing analog signal or real-world signals which humans interact, for example, speech.DSP system converts digital signal to analog signal or vice-versa by the use of converters.The digital image processing is a special type of processor which is used in every electronic device whether it be CD, mobile phones, battlefields, satellites, medical, and voice detection machines etc.Analog Image Processing vs. Digital Image ProcessingThere are following differences between Analog Images Processing and Digital Image Processing:Analog Image ProcessingDigital Image ProcessingThe analog image processing is applied on analog signals and it processes only two-dimensional signals.The digital image processing is applied to digital signals that work on analyzing and manipulating the images.Analog signal is time-varying signals so the images formed under analog image processing get varied.It improves the digital quality of the image and intensity distribution is perfect in it.Analog image processing is a slower and costlier process.Digital image processing is a cheaper and fast image storage and retrieval process.Analog signal is a real-world but not good quality of images.It uses good image compression techniques that reduce the amount of data required and produce good quality of imagesIt is generally continuous and not broken into tiny components.It uses an image segmentation technique which is used to detect discontinuity which occurs due to a broken connection path.Next TopicRelationship between Digital Image and Signal? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
