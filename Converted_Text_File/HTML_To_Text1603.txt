-X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5984/database_name/database_id?_revNote: -X is used to specify a custom request method of HTTP which is used while communicating with the HTTP server. To delete a dcoment, we have to pass the recent revision id through the url with /database_name/database_id/. "?" is used to mention attributes of any data structure.Example:We have a document in our database named "my_database" with id 001. To delete this document first get the rev id of the document by using the following command:curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/my_database/001Here rev id is "2-5fef7ea4661b53c017e167809e4f2beb".Now use the following command to delete the document having the id "001".curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5984/my_database/001?rev=2-5fef7ea4661b53c017e167809e4f2bebThe response of CouchDB for this command contains 3 fields:"ok": It specifies that the operation is successful."id": It stores the id of the document."rev": This indicates the revision id. Every time you revise (update,modify or delete) a document a _rev value will be generated by CouchDB. If you want to update or delete a document, CouchDB expects you to include the _rev field of the revision you want to change. When CouchDB accepts the change, it will generate a new revision number.VerificationYou can verify that your document is deleted by using the following command:curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/my_database/001Here, you can't see the document because it is deleted.Next TopicCouchDB Create View? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
