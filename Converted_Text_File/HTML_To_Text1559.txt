In this type of system, variable changes with time and any type of variation is not found in the input and output signal. In response to the input signal, a continuous system generates an output signal.Suppose, we have two variable x and y and both vary with time. Continuous signals are represented within parenthesis.                (figure describe continuous system)Discrete systemsIn discrete systems, both input and output signals are discrete signals. The variables in the discrete systems vary with time. In this type of system, the changes are predominantly discontinuous. The state of variables in discrete system changes only at a discrete set of points in time.The variables in the discrete system are x and y and they are always presented in square brackets [ ].                (figure describe discrete system)Next TopicHistory of Photography? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
