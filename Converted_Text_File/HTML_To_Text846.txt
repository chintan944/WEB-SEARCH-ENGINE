Due to this reason, its cost is 20% less than Standard IA storage class.It is an optimal choice for the less frequently accessed data but does not require the availability of Standard or Standard IA storage class.It is a good choice for storing the backup data.It is cost-effective storage which is replicated from other AWS region using S3 Cross Region replication.It has the same durability, high performance, and low latency, with a low storage price and low retrieval fee.It designed for 99.5% availability and 99.999999999% durability of objects in a single availability zone.It provides lifecycle management for the automatic migration of objects to other S3 storage classes.The data can be lost at the time of the destruction of an availability zone as it stores the data in a single availability zone.S3 GlacierS3 Glacier storage class is the cheapest storage class, but it can be used for archive only.You can store any amount of data at a lower cost than other storage classes.S3 Glacier provides three types of models:Expedited: In this model, data is stored for a few minutes, and it has a very higher fee.Standard: The retrieval time of the standard model is 3 to 5 hours.Bulk: The retrieval time of the bulk model is 5 to 12 hours.You can upload the objects directly to the S3 Glacier.It is designed for 99.999999999% durability of objects across multiple availability zones.Performance across the Storage classesS3 StandardS3 Standard IAS3 One Zone-IAS3 GlacierDesigned for durability99.99999999%99.99999999%99.99999999%99.99999999%Designed for availability99.99%99.9%99.5%N/AAvailability SLA99.9%99%99%N/AAvailability zones>=3>=31>=3Minimum capacity charge per objectN/A128KB128KB40KBMinimum storage duration chargeN/A30 days30 days90 daysRetrieval feeN/Aper GB retrievedper GB retrievedper GB retrievedFirst byte latencymillisecondsmillisecondsmillisecondsSelect minutes or hoursStorage typeObjectObjectObjectObjectLifecycle transitionsYesYesYesYesNext TopicAWS Versioning? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
