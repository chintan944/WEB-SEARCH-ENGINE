It is used to develop application with powerful data access. It provides server side controls and events to create web application. It is part of the ASP.NET framework. We will discuss it further in next chapters.ASP.NET MVCIt gives us a MVC (Model View Controller), patterns-based way to build dynamic websites. It enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. It also provides many features that enable fast development for creating outstanding applications. We will discuss it further in next chapters.ASP.NET Web PagesIt is used to create dynamic web pages. It provides fast and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML. It helps to add video, link to the social sites. It also provides other features like you can create beautiful sites that conform to the latest web standards.All these are stable and well equipped frameworks. We can create web applications with any of them. These are also based on the .NET Framework and share core functionalities of .NET and ASP.NET.We can use any development style to create application. The selection of style is depends on the skills and experience of the programmer.Although each framework is independent to other, we can combine and use any of that at any level of our application. For example, to develop client interaction module, we can use MVC and for data control, we can use Web Forms.The following table illustrates each development model.ModelSkillsDevelopment styleExperienceWeb FormsWin Forms, WPF, .NETRapid development using a rich library of controls that encapsulate HTML markupMid-Level, Advanced RADMVCRuby on Rails, .NETFull control over HTML markup, code and markup separated, and easy to write tests.
