Acceptance by Final State: The PDA is said to accept its input by the final state if it enters any final state in zero or more moves after reading the entire input.Let P =(Q, ?, ?, ?, q0, Z, F) be a PDA. The language acceptable by the final state can be defined as:L(PDA) = {w | (q0, w, Z) ?* (p, ?, ?), q ? F}2. Acceptance by Empty Stack: On reading the input string from the initial configuration for some PDA, the stack of PDA gets empty.Let P =(Q, ?, ?, ?, q0, Z, F) be a PDA. The language acceptable by empty stack can be defined as:N(PDA) = {w | (q0, w, Z) ?* (p, ?, ?), q ? Q}Equivalence of Acceptance by Final State and Empty StackIf L = N(P1) for some PDA P1, then there is a PDA P2 such that L = L(P2). That means the language accepted by empty stack PDA will also be accepted by final state PDA.If there is a language L = L (P1) for some PDA P1 then there is a PDA P2 such that L = N(P2). That means language accepted by final state PDA is also acceptable by empty stack PDA.Example:Construct a PDA that accepts the language L over {0, 1} by empty stack which accepts all the string of 0's and 1's in which a number of 0's are twice of number of 1's.Solution:There are two parts for designing this PDA:If 1 comes before any 0'sIf 0 comes before any 1's.We are going to design the first part i.e. 1 comes before 0's. The logic is that read single 1 and push two 1's onto the stack. Thereafter on reading two 0's, POP two 1's from the stack. The ? can be?(q0, 1, Z) = (q0, 11, Z)        Here Z represents that stack is empty
?(q0, 0, 1) = (q0, ?)Now, consider the second part i.e. if 0 comes before 1's. The logic is that read first 0, push it onto the stack and change state from q0 to q1. [Note that state q1 indicates that first 0 is read and still second 0 has yet to read].Being in q1, if 1 is encountered then POP 0. Being in q1, if 0 is read then simply read that second 0 and move ahead. The ? will be:?(q0, 0, Z) = (q1, 0Z)
 ?(q1, 0, 0) = (q1, 0)
?(q1, 0, Z) = (q0, ?)        (indicate that one 0 and one 1 is already read, so simply read the second 0)
?(q1, 1, 0) = (q1, ?)Now, summarize the complete PDA for given L is:?(q0, 1, Z) = (q0, 11Z)
?(q0, 0, 1) = (q1, ?)
?(q0, 0, Z) = (q1, 0Z)
?(q1, 0, 0) = (q1, 0)
?(q1, 0, Z) = (q0, ?)
?(q0, ?, Z) = (q0, ?)
