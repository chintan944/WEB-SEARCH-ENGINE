It is the most effective way to represent any language.The languages accepted by some regular expression are referred to as Regular languages.A regular expression can also be described as a sequence of pattern that defines a string.Regular expressions are used to match character combinations in strings. String searching algorithm used this pattern to find the operations on a string.For instance:In a regular expression, x* means zero or more occurrence of x. It can generate {e, x, xx, xxx, xxxx, .....}In a regular expression, x+ means one or more occurrence of x. It can generate {x, xx, xxx, xxxx, .....}Operations on Regular LanguageThe various operations on regular language are:Union: If L and M are two regular languages then their union L U M is also a union.  1. L U M = {s | s is in L or s is in M}Intersection: If L and M are two regular languages then their intersection is also an intersection.  1. L ? M = {st | s is in L and t is in M}Kleen closure: If L is a regular language then its Kleen closure L1* will also be a regular language.  1. L* = Zero or more occurrence of language L.Example 1:Write the regular expression for the language accepting all combinations of a's, over the set ? = {a}Solution:All combinations of a's means a may be zero, single, double and so on. If a is appearing zero times, that means a null string. That is we expect the set of {?, a, aa, aaa, ....}. So we give a regular expression for this as:	R = a*That is Kleen closure of a.Example 2:Write the regular expression for the language accepting all combinations of a's except the null string, over the set ? = {a}Solution:The regular expression has to be built for the languageL = {a, aa, aaa, ....}This set indicates that there is no null string. So we can denote regular expression as:R = a+
Example 3:Write the regular expression for the language accepting all the string containing any number of a's and b's.Solution:The regular expression will be:r.e. = (a + b)*This will give the set as L = {?, a, aa, b, bb, ab, ba, aba, bab, .....}, any combination of a and b.The (a + b)* shows any combination with a and b even a null string.Next TopicExamples of Regular Expression? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
