So, it is commonly used by an internet user to show that he or she expects to be away from his or her computer for a short time. It is also a way to show courtesy so that the other user does not wonder why a person is not replying anything for a while.Online chat example:Person1: Hi..
Person2: Hi..
/// Chat goes on...

After some time....
Person1: I need to go somewhere
