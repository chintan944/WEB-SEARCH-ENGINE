It provides a lot of features that are given below.SimpleMachine Independent or PortableMid-level programming languageStructured programming languageRich LibraryMemory ManagementFast SpeedPointersRecursionExtensibleObject OrientedCompiler based1) SimpleC++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.2) Machine Independent or PortableUnlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.3) Mid-level programming languageC++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.4) Structured programming languageC++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.5) Rich LibraryC++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.6) Memory ManagementIt supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.7) SpeedThe compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.8) PointerC++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array etc.9) RecursionIn C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.10) ExtensibleC++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.11) Object OrientedC++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.12) Compiler basedC++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++ program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and then we can execute our program.Next TopicC++ Installation? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
