Counting sort calculates the number of occurrence of objects and stores its key values. New array is formed by adding previous key elements and assigning to objects.ComplexityTime Complexity: O(n+k) is worst case where n is the number of element and k is the range of input.Space Complexity: O(k) k is the range of input.ComplexityBest CaseAverage CaseWorst CaseTime Complexity?(n+k)?(n+k)O(n+k)Space ComplexityO(k)Limitation of Counting SortIt is effective when range is not greater than number of object.It is not comparison based complexity.It is also used as sub-algorithm for different algorithm.It uses partial hashing technique to count the occurrence.It is also used for negative inputs.AlgorithmSTEP 1 STARTSTEP 2 Store the input arraySTEP 3 Count the key values by number of occurrence of objectSTEP 4 Update the array by adding previous key elements and assigning to objectsSTEP 5 Sort by replacing the object into new array and key= key-1STEP 6 STOPProgram#include <stdio.h>
