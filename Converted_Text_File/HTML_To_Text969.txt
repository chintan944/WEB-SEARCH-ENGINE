Negation: It means the opposite of the original statement. If p is a statement, then the negation of p is denoted by ~p and read as 'it is not the case that p.' So, if p is true then ~ p is false and vice versa.Example: If statement p is Paris is in France, then ~ p is 'Paris is not in France'.p~ pTFFT2. Conjunction: It means Anding of two statements. If p, q are two statements, then "p and q" is a compound statement, denoted by p ? q and referred as the conjunction of p and q. The conjunction of p and q is true only when both p and q are true. Otherwise, it is false.pqp ? qTTTTFFFTFFFF3. Disjunction: It means Oring of two statements. If p, q are two statements, then "p or q" is a compound statement, denoted by p ? q and referred to as the disjunction of p and q. The disjunction of p and q is true whenever at least one of the two statements is true, and it is false only when both p and q are false.pqp ? qTTTTFTFTTFFF4. Implication / if-then (?): An implication p?q is the proposition "if p, then q." It is false if p is true and q is false. The rest cases are true.pqp ? qTTTTFFFTTFFF5. If and Only If (?): p ? q is bi-conditional logical connective which is true when p and q are same, i.e., both are false or both are true.pqp ? qTTTTFFFTFFFTDerived Connectors1. NAND: It means negation after ANDing of two statements. Assume p and q be two propositions. Nanding of pand q to be a proposition which is false when both p and q are true, otherwise true. It is denoted by p ? q.pqp ? qTTFTFTFTTFFT2. NOR or Joint Denial: It means negation after ORing of two statements. Assume p and q be two propositions. NORing of p and q to be a proposition which is true when both p and q are false, otherwise false. It is denoted by p ? q.pqp ? qTTFTFFFTFFFT3. XOR: Assume p and q be two propositions. XORing of p and q is true if p is true or q is true but not both and vice-versa. It is denoted by p ? q.pqp ? qTTFTFTFTTFFFExample1: Prove that X ? Y ? (X ??Y)?(?X?Y).Solution: Construct the truth table for both the propositions.XYX?Y?Y?XX ??Y?X?Y(X ??Y)?(?X?Y)TTFFFFFFTFTTFTFTFTTFTFTTFFFTTFFFAs the truth table for both the proposition is the same.  X ? Y ? (X ??Y)?(?X?Y). Hence Proved.Example2: Show that (p ?q) ?(p?q) is equivalent to p ? q.Solution: Construct the truth table for both the propositions.pqp?q(p?q)(p?q)?
