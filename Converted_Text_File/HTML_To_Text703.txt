We are only required to specify the endpoints of the object whose dimension is to be measured.The steps to select continue and baseline dimension on the ribbon panel are listed below:Click on the Annotate option on the ribbon panel.Click on the drop-down list of the continue dimension, as shown in the below image:We can select the appropriate dimension accordingly.Continue DimensionIt is also named as chain dimension. The dimension will be measured from the current point.The shortcut command of the continue dimension is DCO.It will continue to create dimensions from the last ordinate, angular, or linear created dimension, which lines up automatically.We need to select the base of the dimension from the ordinate, angular, or linear for the continue dimension.Let's understand with two examples.Example 1: Linear continue dimensionConsider the below image:Note: The precision value of decimal points can be modified, which is discussed in the topic Dimension Style Manager.Here, we have created a linear dimension. It will work as a base for continue dimension.The steps are listed below:Type DCO or DIMCONTINUE on the command line or command prompt.Press Enter.Select the continued dimension. Here, we will select the first linear dimension created in the above figure.The dimension will automatically start from the endpoint of the last created dimension, as shown in the below image:Here, we have used the linear dimension, so further dimensions will be considered linear by default.Continue specifying the second extension line origin points, as shown in the below image:Press Enter or Esc to exit.The figure will now look like the below image:Example 2: Angular continue dimensionConsider the below image:The steps are listed below:Type DCO or DIMCONTINUE on the command line or command prompt.Press Enter.Select the continued dimension. Here, we will select the first angular dimension created in the above figure.Here, we have used the angular dimension, so further dimensions will be considered angular by default.Continue specifying second extension line origin points, as shown in the below image:Press Enter or Esc to exit.The figure will now look like the below image:Baseline DimensionThe dimension will be measured from the base of the first dimension.OrThe dimension will be measured from the starting point of the figure.The baseline dimension consists of multiple dimensions, which are measured from the same location.The shortcut command of the Baseline dimension is DBA.Let's understand by example.Consider the below figure:The steps are listed below:Type DBA or DIMBASELINE on the command line or command prompt.Press Enter.Select the base dimension. Here, we will select the first linear dimension created in the above figure.The dimension will automatically start from the starting point of the last dimension. Here, we have used the linear dimension, so further dimensions will be considered linear by default.Continue specifying the second extension line origin points, as shown in the below image:Press Enter or Esc to exit.The figure will now look like the below image:Next TopicDimension Style Manager? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
