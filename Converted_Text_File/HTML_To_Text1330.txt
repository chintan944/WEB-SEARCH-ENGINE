The output is always given in true or false by a conditional statement. COBOL contains various types of conditional statements:If condition statementRelation StatementSign StatementClass StatementCondition - Name StatementNegated ConditionCombined ConditionIf Condition StatementIf condition statement is used to check for a condition if a condition is true, the IF block is executed, and if the condition is false, the ELSE block is executed.IF statement mainly has three types based on its usage in the COBOL program:Simple IFSimple IF is mainly used to execute the condition related code. If the condition is true, then it will execute the set of statements written in the IF block. If condition is not satisfied, the control will transfer to the next statements after the IF statement terminated.Syntax:IF Condition  
	{Statement Block}
[END-IF].Here, END-IF is the scope terminator, which is optional in the program. The period (.) can be defined at the last statement of IF block.If we didn't specify the period, then scope terminator END-IF is mandatory.IF ELSEIF ELSE statement is used when a certain set of statements needed to be executed by two conditions. This statement is mainly used to execute the condition-specific code.In IF-ELSE, the block of statements will be executed if the specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the other set of statements will be executed, and those set will be under the ELSE block.Syntax:IF Condition-1
	{Statement-Block-1/NEXT SENTENCE}
[ELSE]  
	{Statement-Block-2/NEXT SENTENCE}
[END-IF].Nested IFLike other COBOL programming languages, COBOL also allows the nested IF statement. IF statement within the IF statement called as nested IF statement. There is no bound to the depth of nested IF statements.Syntax:IF Condition-1 THEN
	IF Condition-2 THEN
		Statements-block-1
	[ELSE
		Statements-block-2
	END-IF]
[ELSE
	IF Condition-3 THEN
		Statements-block-3
	[ELSE
		Statements-block-4
	END-IF]

       STOP RUN.Output:Relation ConditionThe relation condition contrasts two operands. These operands can be an identifier, literal, or arithmetic expression.A comparison of algebraic numeric fields is conducted regardless of size and usage clause.For Non-numeric operandsBy comparing two non-numeric operands of equal size, the characters will be measured from the left with the corresponding positions until the end is reached. The operand with more characters is considered to be larger.While comparing two operands of different sizes, the shorter data item will be appended with spaces at the end until the operand's size is equal and then compared according to the rules stated in the preceding paragraph.The Relational operator defines the type of comparison to be made as given below:Relational OperatorWe can write asDescriptionIS EQUAL TOIS =It means, Equal toIS GREATER THANIS >It means, Greater thanIS LESS THANIS <It means, Less thanIS NOT GREATER THANIS NOT >It means, Not greater thanIS NOT LESS THANIS NOT <It means, Not less thanIS NOT EQUAL TOIS NOT =It means, Not equal toIS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TOIS >=It means, Is greater than or equal toIS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TOIS <=It means, Is less than or equal toSyntax:[Data Name/Arithmetic Operation]
