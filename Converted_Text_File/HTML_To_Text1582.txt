Fiat money that has value only because of government regulation or law is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. It is based on the faith and credit of the economy. Most modern paper currencies are fiat currencies.Every cryptocurrency newcomers want to know how to cash out bitcoin or withdraw from bitcoins into fiat currency(USD, EUR, INR) which will be acceptable in their native countries. There are some easy ways to convert BTC into USD, INR, EUR or GBP, some of them are listed below. Before picking any of the listed methods, you need to find out how you want to receive your fiat currency. You can sell Bitcoins in person for cash or can sell it on exchanges and get the money directly into your bank account. You can also spend your Bitcoin to buy stuff from Amazon.Cryptocurrency ExchangeThe first one is to use a cryptocurrency exchange. Whenever you want to go on a business trip or other countries, the first thing you need to do is that you have to go to a currency exchange centre. The exchange centre switches your local currency with the currency of that country where you are visiting. It's the same thing with bitcoin. There are cryptocurrency exchanges that will convert your cryptocurrency into your local currency such as US dollars, euros or yen. There are many options available to do the exchanges of your currencies, such as Coinbase. The Coinbase is available in over 30 different countries, which can easily convert your bitcoins into currency and deposit it directly into your bank account. There are other alternatives available such as Kraken, Gemini, BitStamp.Bitcoin Debit CardIt is also used to convert your bitcoin into fiat currency. The bitcoin debit cards allow their users to deposit their crypto coins via an online website which automatically converts them into a fiat currency such as Dollar or Euro. There are multiple options available for this. For example, Coinbase offers a Visa Bitcoin debit card. This card enables you to keep your holdings in bitcoin, and you can be paying anywhere that accepts Visa using your Bitcoin debit card.Selling BitcoinsThe next option is to sell your bitcoins to someone else. As we know that, you can transfer bitcoin directly to another person without involving the services of a third-party such as a bank or a credit card. So you simply need to find out somebody who wants to buy your Bitcoins. When the buyer is available, you can transfer your bitcoins directly into their wallet and can get paid for that. In this type of transfer, there are some security risks involved because when you do a transfer of bitcoin to someone else, that transaction is irreversible. So if you send your bitcoins to someone else and that person does not pay you for the bitcoins, then there is no way to retrieve your bitcoins back. So whenever you are going to sell bitcoins to someone else whether it's a family member, a friend, or some other person, make sure that you can trust on this person, and you are going to get paid for the bitcoins that you send.Bitcoin ATMsBitcoin ATM is also known as BTMs or Bitcoin Teller Machines. It is a machine where you can buy bitcoins or can sell your bitcoins. Bitcoin ATMs are available in most major cities around the world. The bitcoin ATMs provides a relatively fast and easiest way to quickly withdraw funds in your local fiat currency against your bitcoin holdings. Many Bitcoin ATMs also allow users to buy Bitcoin with money in much the same way as someone deposit money into their bank account at a regular ATM.Next TopicBlockchain Interview Questions? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
