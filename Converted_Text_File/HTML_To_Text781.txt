All the grammar are not always optimized that means the grammar may consist of some extra symbols(non-terminal). Having extra symbols, unnecessary increase the length of grammar. Simplification of grammar means reduction of grammar by removing useless symbols. The properties of reduced grammar are given below:Each variable (i.e. non-terminal) and each terminal of G appears in the derivation of some word in L.There should not be any production as X ? Y where X and Y are non-terminal.If ? is not in the language L then there need not to be the production X ? ?.Let us study the reduction process in detail./p> Removal of Useless SymbolsA symbol can be useless if it does not appear on the right-hand side of the production rule and does not take part in the derivation of any string. That symbol is known as a useless symbol. Similarly, a variable can be useless if it does not take part in the derivation of any string. That variable is known as a useless variable.For Example:T ? aaB | abA | aaT
A ? aA
B ? ab | b
C ? adIn the above example, the variable 'C' will never occur in the derivation of any string, so the production C ? ad is useless. So we will eliminate it, and the other productions are written in such a way that variable C can never reach from the starting variable 'T'.Production A ? aA is also useless because there is no way to terminate it. If it never terminates, then it can never produce a string. Hence this production can never take part in any derivation.To remove this useless production A ? aA, we will first find all the variables which will never lead to a terminal string such as variable 'A'. Then we will remove all the productions in which the variable 'B' occurs.Elimination of ? ProductionThe productions of type S ? ? are called ? productions. These type of productions can only be removed from those grammars that do not generate ?.Step 1: First find out all nullable non-terminal variable which derives ?.Step 2: For each production A ? a, construct all production A ? x, where x is obtained from a by removing one or more non-terminal from step 1.Step 3: Now combine the result of step 2 with the original production and remove ? productions.Example:Remove the production from the following CFG by preserving the meaning of it.S ? XYX
X ? 0X | ?
Y ? 1Y | ?Solution:Now, while removing ? production, we are deleting the rule X ? ? and Y ? ?. To preserve the meaning of CFG we are actually placing ? at the right-hand side whenever X and Y have appeared.Let us takeS ? XYXIf the first X at right-hand side is ?. ThenS ? YXSimilarly if the last X in R.H.S. = ?. ThenS ? XYIf Y = ? thenS ? XXIf Y and X are ? then,S ? XIf both X are replaced by ?S ? YNow,S ? XY | YX | XX | X | YNow let us considerX ? 0XIf we place ? at right-hand side for X then,X ? 0
X ? 0X | 0Similarly Y ? 1Y | 1Collectively we can rewrite the CFG with removed ? production asS ? XY | YX | XX | X | Y
X ? 0X | 0
Y ? 1Y | 1Removing Unit ProductionsThe unit productions are the productions in which one non-terminal gives another non-terminal. Use the following steps to remove unit production:Step 1: To remove X ? Y, add production X ? a to the grammar rule whenever Y ? a occurs in the grammar.Step 2: Now delete X ? Y from the grammar.Step 3: Repeat step 1 and step 2 until all unit productions are removed.For example:S ? 0A | 1B | C
A ? 0S | 00
B ? 1 | A
C ? 01Solution:S ? C is a unit production. But while removing S ? C we have to consider what C gives. So, we can add a rule to S.S ? 0A | 1B | 01Similarly, B ? A is also a unit production so we can modify it asB ? 1 | 0S | 00Thus finally we can write CFG without unit production asS ? 0A | 1B | 01
A ? 0S | 00
B ? 1 | 0S | 00
C ? 01Next TopicChomsky's Normal Form (CNF)? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
