When there are no cycles of negative weight, then we can find out the shortest path between source and destination.It is slower than Dijkstra's Algorithm but more versatile, as it capable of handling some of the negative weight edges.This algorithm detects the negative cycle in a graph and reports their existence.Based on the "Principle of Relaxation" in which more accurate values gradually recovered an approximation to the proper distance by until eventually reaching the optimum solution.Given a weighted directed graph G = (V, E) with source s and weight function w: E ? R, the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns a Boolean value indicating whether or not there is a negative weight cycle that is attainable from the source. If there is such a cycle, the algorithm produces the shortest paths and their weights. The algorithm returns TRUE if and only if a graph contains no negative - weight cycles that are reachable from the source.Recurrence Relationdistk [u] = [min[distk-1 [u],min[ distk-1 [i]+cost [i,u]]] as i except u.k ? k is the source vertexu ? u is the destination vertexi ? no of edges to be scanned concerning a vertex.BELLMAN -FORD (G, w, s)
