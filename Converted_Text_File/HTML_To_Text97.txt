Due to the agile methodology, the development process is aligned to deliver the changing business requirement. Using Agile methodology, the software is distributed with fasterand fewer changes.Scrum is a framework of agile that helps agile teams to work together. Using it, the team members development, deliver and sustain the complex product. It encourages the team to learn through practice, self-organize while working on the problem. Scum is a work done through the framework and continuously shipping values to customers.AgileAgile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development methodology.In this approach, the leadership plays an important role.Agile software development is highly suitable for the medium or large project.Flexibility is the most significant advantage of agile as it quickly reacts to changes.Agile involves face-to-face communication and collaboration between the members of various cross-functional teams.Agile development needs frequent delivery to the end user for their feedback.In this development, each step like requirements, analysis, design, are continually monitored during the lifecycle.The project leader takes cares of all the tasks in the agile method.End-user may give their feedback during the development process. So, the end product will be more useful.Delivery and update of the software are taking place regularly.Design and execution should be kept simple.The priority of agile development is always to satisfy the customer by providing continuous delivery of valuable software.Working software is the most fundamental measure of progress.It is best to have face-to-face communication to get as close to the project goal as possible.ScrumScrum is a framework of agile methodology. In which incremental builds are delivered to end user in every two to three weeks.Scrum's team is self-organized, cross-functional team.Scrum is used in the project where the requirement rapidly changes. vA compared to agile it is more rigid. So that there are no chances of frequent change.In daily stand up meeting the teamwork is achieved with a fixed role assigned to team members, scrum master, and product owner.No need to change many more while implementing scrum process.In this process, a build is delivered after each sprint to the client for their feedback.After every sprint a demonstration of functionality is provided. So that the regular feedback can be taken before next sprint.There is no team leader, so the entire team handles the issues or problems.When the team completes the current sprint activity, then the next sprint is planned.Design and execution can be innovative and experimental.The daily sprint meeting is organized to review the feedback to decide the future progress of the project.Working software is not a fundamental measure.The target of the Scrum team is to deliver maximum business value.Next TopicAgile Daily Stand-up? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
