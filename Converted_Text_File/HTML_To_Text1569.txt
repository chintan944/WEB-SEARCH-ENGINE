Current = iL(0)
Capacitor Voltage = Vc(0) Thus, the state of the network at time t=0 is specified by the inductor current and capacitor voltage.Therefore iL(0) and Vc(0) is called the initial state of the network and the pair iL(t), Vc(t) is called the state of the network at 't'. The variable iL and vc are called the state variables of the network.Apply KVLAlso,From eq.1This type of equation is called State equation. And the variables present in this equation are called state variables.Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 can be written in matrix form asThe general form of state equation isx ?(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)  ........Eq.6y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)      ........Eq.7Y = n- dimensional output vectorU = r-dimensional control vector or input vectorA = n × n system matrixB = n × r control matrixC = n × n output matrixWhen there is no direct connection between input and output in that case D u(t) is not taken.State Space Representation of nth order differential EquationFor the nth order differential equationExample 1A system is described by the differential equationWhere y is the output and u is the input to the system. Obtain the state space representation of the system.SolutionNext Topic#? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
