B and g: B ? C. The composition of f with g is a function from A into C defined by (gof) (x) = g [f(x)] and is defined by gof.      To find the composition of f and g, first find the image of x under f and then find the image of f (x) under g.Example1:Let X = {1, 2, 3}
    Y = {a, b}
    Z = {5, 6, 7}.Consider the function f = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b)} and g = {(a, 5), (b, 7)} as in figure. Find the composition of gof.Solution: The composition function gof is shown in fig:(gof) (1) = g [f (1)] = g (a) = 5, (gof) (2) = g [f (2)] = g (a) = 5
(gof) (3) = g [f (3)] = g (b) = 7.Example2: Consider f, g and h, all functions on the integers, by f (n) =n2, g (n) = n + 1 and h (n) = n - 1.Determine (i) hofog       (ii) gofoh       (iii) fogoh.Solution: (i) hofog (n) = n + 1,
    hofog (n + 1) = (n+1)2 
h [(n+1)2 ] = (n+1)2 - 1 = n2 + 1 + 2n - 1 = n2 + 2n.

(ii) gofoh (n) = n - 1, gof (n - 1) = (n-1)2 
     g [(n-1)2 ] = (n-1)2 + 1 = n2 + 1 - 2n + 1 = n2 - 2n + 2.
	 
(iii) fogoh (n) = n - 1
      fog (n - 1) = (n - 1) + 1
      f (n) = n2.Note:If f and g are one-to-one, then the function (gof) (gof) is also one-to-one.If f and g are onto then the function (gof) (gof) is also onto.Composition consistently holds associative property but does not hold commutative property.Next TopicMathematical Functions? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
