It has two parallel faces that have congruent circles. It has a curved surface. The perpendicular distance between the two bases is the height of the cylinder.Area of Cylinder formulaArea of cylinder (A) = 2?r2 + 2?rhORArea of cylinder (A) = 2?r (r + h)Where:? is a constant whose value is 3.14.r is the radius.h is the height of the cylinderTypes of CylinderThere are two types of cylinder:Right Cylinder: If the bases of the cylinder are at the exact position and the axis is at a right angle to the base is called the right cylinder.Oblique Cylinder: If the bases of the cylinder are not at the position and the axis is not a right angle to the base, it is called an oblique cylinder.DerivationA cylinder is made up of two circles and a rectangle. If you want to derive the formula of area of the cylinder, follow the steps given below:Divide the cylinder into three parts: two circles and a rectangle.Unroll the sides that form a rectangle.Calculate the area of each circle separately. We know that the area of the circle is ?r2. Adding the area of both circles we get (?r2 + ?r2 = 2?r2).Calculate the area of the rectangle that is width times height. Where h is height, and the length of the cylinder is the distance around the circle. It means it is the circumference of the circle that is 2?r. Hence the area of the rectangle will be 2?r*h.Now add the area of the circle that is 2?r2 and the area of a rectangle that is 2?rh.Area of cylinder (A) = 2?r2 + 2?rhORArea of cylinder (A) = 2?r (r + h)Where:? is a constantr is the radiush is the height of the cylinderExamplesExample 1: If the diameter of a cylinder is 15 cm and the height is 7 cm. Find the surface area of the cylinder.Solution:We have given, diameter (d) = 15 cmheight (h) =7 cmwe know that, radius is half of the diameter.r = d/2r = 15 / 2 = 7.5 cmWe know that,Area of cylinder (A) = 2?r (r + h)A = 2 * 3.14 * 7.5 (7.5 + 7)A = 682.95 cm2The area of the cylinder is 682.95 cm2.Surface area of the hollow cylinderExample 2: The following figure shows a pipe. The internal and external radius of the pipe is 4 cm and 4.4 cm, respectively. The pipe is 9 cm is long. Find the total surface area of the pipe.Solution:In this question, we have given two radiuses, internal and external. The r represents the internal radius, and R represents the external radius.We have given,r = 4 cm, R = 4.4 cm and h = 9 cmTotal surface area of the pipe (A) = area of internal circle + area of external circle + area of two circlesA=2?rh+ 2?Rh+2(?R2- ?r2)A = 2?.4.9 + 2?.(4.4).9 + (2. (?.(4.42)-?.42))A = 72? + 79.2? +(2. (19.36? - 16?))A = 72? + 79.2? +(2. (3.36?))A = 72? + 79.2? + 6.72?A = 157.92?A = 157.92 * 3.14A = 495.86 cm2The area of cylinder is 495.86 cm2.Next TopicArea of Square? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
