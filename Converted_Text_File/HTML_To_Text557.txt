It means that a closed-shape that has four sides with one pair of parallel sides.In this section, we will learn how to find the area of a trapezoid.TrapezoidThe trapezoid is a gematrical shape that has four-sides in which a pair of opposite sides must be parallel is called trapezoid. The parallel sides are known as base, and the non-parallel sides are known as leg. The parallel sides can be horizontal, vertical, or slanting (diagonal). It is also known as trapezium.In the following figure, base1 and base2 are perpendicular to the dotted line, which represents the altitude (height). The altitude is perpendicular to the distance between two bases.Properties of a TrapezoidA trapezoid is a parallelogram if both pairs of its opposite sides are parallel.A trapezoid is a square if both pairs of its opposite sides are parallel; all its sides are of equal length and at right angles to each other.A trapezoid can be a rectangle if both pairs of its opposite sides are parallel; its opposite sides are of equal length and are at right angles to each other.Each base must be perpendicular to the height.Types of TrapezoidThere are three types of trapezoid:Right trapezoid: It contains a pair of right angles.Isosceles trapezoid: A trapezoid shape that has an equal length of non-parallel sides. In the following image, the sides AD and BC are of the same length.Scalene trapezoid: A trapezoid shape that has neither equal sides nor equal angles.The different shape of trapezoid are:To find the area of the trapezoid follows the steps below:Add the basesMultiply the sum by heightDivide the result by 2Area of Trapezoid FormulaThe area of a trapezoid is the average width times the altitude. On implementing it in the formula:Area of trapezoid (A) = ½ (b1 + b2) * hOr Area of trapezoid (A) = h/2 * (b1 + b2)Or Area of trapezoid (A) = h * (b1 + b2/2)Where b1 and b2 are the lengths of each base, and h represents the altitude.Derivation of Trapezoid FormulaLet’s derive the formula by using the parallelogram from two congruent trapezoids.Draw a trapezoid whose base length is b1 and b2, and altitude is h.Create a copy of it.Rotate the copy of the trapezoid by .Add a copy of the trapezoid to the original trapezoid.When we combine the two trapezoids (as above), it forms a parallelogram shape. The newly formed shape has two pairs of opposite congruent sides.We know that:area of a parallelogram (A) = b * hIt means the area of a parallelogram is altitude (height) times the length of either base. From the above figure, the length of both the bases is equal to b1 + b2.According to the formula of the parallelogram, we getA = (b1 + b2) * hThe above area is the area of two trapezoids. So, we need to divide it by 2 to get the area of one trapezoid.Area of trapezoid (A) = (b1 + b2) * h / 2Arranging the above formula, we get:Area of trapezoid (A) = ½ * h * (b1 + b2)Another way to calculate the area of a trapezoid by dividing the trapezoid into two triangles.Now we have two triangles ?ABD and ?BCD. We will calculate the area of the triangles separately. The total area of the triangles will be the area of the trapezoid.Area of ?A = ½ b1 * hArea of ?A = ½ b2 * hAdding the area, we get:A + A = ½ (b1 * h) + ½ (b2 * h)2A = (b1 + b2) * hA = 1/2 (b1 + b2) * hExamplesExample 1: If the bases of a trapezoid are 30 inches and 20 inches. The height of trapezoid is 4 inches. Find the area of the trapezoid.Solution:Given, b1 = 30 inches, b2 = 20 inches and height = 4 inchesArea of trapezoid (A) = 1/2 (b1 + b2) * h A = ½ (30 + 20) * 4A = ½ (50) * 4A = 200/2A = 100 in2The area of trapezoid is 100 in2.Example 2: Find the area of the given trapezoid.Solution: From the above figure, we will consider only parallel sides AB and CD because it makes the right angle with the parallel sides.Given, b1=12 cm, b2=8 cm and h=6 cmWe know that,A = h/2 (b1 + b2)Putting the values in the above formula, we get:A = 6/2(12 + 8)A = 6/2 (20)A = 60 cm2The area of the trapezoid is 60 cm2.Example 3: Find the area of a trapezoid whose bases are 10 m and 7 m, respectively. The altitude of the trapezoid is 5 m. Find the area.Solution:First, we will divide the trapezoid into two triangles, as we have shown in the following figure.Now find the area of triangles separately. We know that:Area of triangle (A) = 1/2 b * hArea of ?ABC = ½ (7 * 5)A = 35/2A = 17.5 m2Similarly, the area of ?CDA = ½ (10 * 5)A = 50/2A = 25 m2Adding the area of ?ABC and ?CDA we get the total area of the trapezoid.Area of trapezoid = Area of ?ABC + Area of ?CDAArea of trapezoid (A) = 17.5 + 25A = 42.5 m2The area of the trapezoid is 42.5 m2.Next TopicArea of Parallelogram? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
