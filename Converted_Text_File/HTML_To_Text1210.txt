Following is a list of some popular features of Cassandra:High ScalabilityCassandra is highly scalable which facilitates you to add more hardware to attach more customers and more data as per requirement.Rigid ArchitectureCassandra has not a single point of failure and it is continuously available for business-critical applications that cannot afford a failure.Fast Linear-scale PerformanceCassandra is linearly scalable. It increases your throughput because it facilitates you to increase the number of nodes in the cluster. Therefore it maintains a quick response time.Fault tolerantCassandra is fault tolerant. Suppose, there are 4 nodes in a cluster, here each node has a copy of same data. If one node is no longer serving then other three nodes can served as per request.Flexible Data StorageCassandra supports all possible data formats like structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. It facilitates you to make changes to your data structures according to your need.Easy Data DistributionData distribution in Cassandra is very easy because it provides the flexibility to distribute data where you need by replicating data across multiple data centers.Transaction SupportCassandra supports properties like Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID).Fast writesCassandra was designed to run on cheap commodity hardware. It performs blazingly fast writes and can store hundreds of terabytes of data, without sacrificing the read efficiency.Next TopicCassandra architecture? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
