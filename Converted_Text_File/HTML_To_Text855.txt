They follow different philosophy in curing diseases. Ayurveda believes in preventing diseases while homeopathy believes in curing a disease. Let us see how they differ from each other!Ayurveda:Ayurveda, which is originated in India more than 3500 years ago, is an alternate system of medicine. It is described in the Atharvaveda. The Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are the two foundational textbooks of Ayurveda that have survived from ancient India. The word Ayurveda is derived from two Sanskrit words "Ayur" meaning life and "Veda" meaning knowledge. So, Ayurveda means knowledge of life.Ayurveda gives emphasis on the balance between body, mind and soul for healthy living. It uses herbs and minerals to bring balance to the Body and Mind. It also gives emphasis on good digestion, proper excretion, exercise, yoga, meditation etc.Ayurveda believes that human body is made up of five elements: the earth (Prithvi), water (Jal), fire (Agni), air (Vayu) and space (Aakash). According to Ayurveda, there should be a harmony among the three elements in our body which include the Vat (wind), Pit (bile) and the Kaf (phlegm). A person falls sick if the balance amongst these three elements is disturbed. In Ayurveda, the medicines are prepared from herbs, vegetables and sometimes animal materials are also used.Homeopathy:Homeopathy is also an alternate system of medicine. The term homeopathy is derived from two Greek words: "homoios" meaning like and "pathos" meaning suffering. It is based on the principle that "like cures like", meaning the substance which can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be consumed in a small amount to cure a sick person with the same symptoms. Such substances which are used as homeopathic medicines trigger body's immune system to fight against the disease.This system of alternative medicine was created by Samuel Hanemann, a German physician, in the late 18th century. The homeopathic medicines are prepared by diluting parts of plants and vegetables, minerals and synthetic materials in distilled water or alcohol.Based on the above information, some of the key differences between Ayurveda and Homeopathy are as follows:AyurvedaHomeopathyIt is an alternate system of medicine, originated in India more than 3500 years ago.It is an alternate system of medicine, introduced by Samuel Christian Hahnemann in the late 18th Century.It is made of two Sanskrit words: "Ayur" means life and "Veda" means knowledge so it means knowledge of life.It is derived from two Greek words: "Homoios" means similar and "Pathos" means "suffering".It believes in the prevention of diseases.It gives emphasis on curing diseases.It believes the health of a person depends on the balance among three elements: Vat (wind), Pit (bile) and Kaf (phlegm).It is based on the principle of "like cures like", meaning a substance which causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in small amount to treat a sick person with similar symptoms.Medicines are prepared from herbs, vegetables and minerals etc.Medicines are prepared by diluting plant parts, vegetables, minerals etc, in alcohol or distilled water.Medicines are not individualized as same medicine can be given to different persons suffering from similar disease.Homeopathic medicines are individualized, specific medicine for a specific person.Next TopicDifference between? prev next ?Help Others, Please ShareLearn Latest TutorialsOpenpyxlTallyGodotSpring BootGradleUMLANNES6FlutterSelenium PyFirebaseCobolPreparationAptitudeReasoningVerbal A.InterviewCompanyTrending TechnologiesAIAWSSeleniumCloudHadoopReactJSD.
