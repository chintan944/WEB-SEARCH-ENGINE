Our Computer Networking Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.Our Computer Network tutorial includes all topics of Computer Network such as introduction, features, types of computer network, architecture, hardware, software, internet, intranet, website, LAN, WAN, etc.What is Computer Network?A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving the data. The links connecting the nodes are known as communication channels.Computer Network uses distributed processing in which task is divided among several computers. Instead, a single computer handles an entire task, each separate computer handles a subset.Following are the advantages of Distributed processing:Security: It provides limited interaction that a user can have with the entire system. For example, a bank allows the users to access their own accounts through an ATM without allowing them to access the bank's entire database.Faster problem solving: Multiple computers can solve the problem faster than a single machine working alone.Security through redundancy: Multiple computers running the same program at the same time can provide the security through redundancy. For example, if four computers run the same program and any computer has a hardware error, then other computers can override it.Computer Network Tutorial IndexComputer NetworkComputer Network TutorialIntroductionFeaturesArchitectureComponentsComputer Network TypesTopologiesTransmission ModesModelsModelsOSI ModelTCP/IP ModelPhysical LayerDigital TransmissionTransmission MediaGuided MediaUnGuided MediaMultiplexingMultiplexing TechniquesSwitchingSwitching ModesSwitching TechniquesData Link layerData Link layerError DetectionError CorrectionData Link ControlsNetwork LayerNetwork LayerNetwork AddressingRoutingNetwork Layer ProtocolsRouting AlgorithmRouting AlgorithmDistance VectorLink State RoutingTransport LayerTransport LayerTransport Layer ProtocolsApplication LayerApplication LayerClient and Server ModelApplication ProtocolsDNSFTPTelnetSMTPSNMPHTTPComputer Network SecuritySecurityPrivacyDigital SignaturePGPPrerequisiteThere is nothing specific prerequisite for learning computer network.AudienceOur Computer Network Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.ProblemsWe assure that you will not find any problem in this Computer Network Tutorial.
